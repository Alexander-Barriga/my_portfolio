       "  'body': \"I've always found it hard to connect more deeply with my dad, and it's been something I've struggled with for a while. Hey Alexander,Earlier this year I went to Malaysia, and one of my goals was to connect more with my father-in-law. He's had a tough life for many reasons I won't go into, and as a result he can sometimes be a little closedoff.It's always been one of my goals to try to deeply connect with him because I love him. If it wasn't for him sending his daughter to study in Australia, I would have never met my wife. All the hard work he did to fund her studies while she was in Australia - it's a debt I don't think I can ever repay.I just hope in this life I can connect with him and love him as much as I can.On our last annual trip to Malaysia earlier this year, I was able to connect with him on multiple occasions and we had beautiful conversations about life. For the first time, I felt like we were able to connect on a really deep level.I don't mean to brag, but I even got to sit next to him in his birthday photo This was a big deal for me.There's an art to conversations, and it's a skill that anyone can learn. And as you learn this skill you'llbe able to create deeper and more meaningful relationships with those around you.And if this is something you struggle with, I am running a free training on conversational frameworks where I will share 3 powerful frameworks to help you:* Become more confident in everyday conversations* Avoid awkward silences in social interactions* Level up your ability to answer questions ON THE SPOT!* Build deeper connections* And learn how to increase your visibility at work!I'm in Vinh, save me a seat!! hope to see you there Alexander!VinhPS. This is where I started in family photos lol look at me now! Lol look how long that arrow is below compared to the arrow above. Success!

       "  'body': \"I've always found it hard to connect more deeply with my dad, and it's been something I've struggled with for a while. Hey Alexander,Earlier this year I went to Malaysia, and one of my goals was to connect more with my father-in-law. He's had a tough life for many reasons I won't go into, and as a result he can sometimes be a little closedoff.It's always been one of my goals to try to deeply connect with him because I love him. If it wasn't for him sending his daughter to study in Australia, I would have never met my wife. All the hard work he did to fund her studies while she was in Australia - it's a debt I don't think I can ever repay.I just hope in this life I can connect with him and love him as much as I can.On our last annual trip to Malaysia earlier this year, I was able to connect with him on multiple occasions and we had beautiful conversations about life. For the first time, I felt like we were able to connect on a really deep level.I don't mean to brag, but I even got to sit next to him in his birthday photo This was a big deal for me.There's an art to conversations, and it's a skill that anyone can learn. And as you learn this skill you'llbe able to create deeper and more meaningful relationships with those around you.And if this is something you struggle with, I am running a free training on conversational frameworks where I will share 3 powerful frameworks to help you:* Become more confident in everyday conversations* Avoid awkward silences in social interactions* Level up your ability to answer questions ON THE SPOT!* Build deeper connections* And learn how to increase your visibility at work!I'm in Vinh, save me a seat!! hope to see you there Alexander!VinhPS. This is where I started in family photos lol look at me now! Lol look how long that arrow is below compared to the arrow above. Success!

       "  'timestamp': '2025-02-24 13:50:30-08',\n",
       "  'body': ' When companies invest in DEI, they invest in people.[ ]89,000 MoveOn members have signed the petition telling Target\\'s leadership to uphold its commitment to DEI. Will you join us? Dear fellow MoveOn member, Target is one of the major corporations disappointingly rolling back diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts in order to align themselves with Trump\\'s hateful agenda. Already, these efforts are harming Target\\'s reputation as a socially conscious leader and leaving Black-owned small businesses confused about what’s on the horizon.^1 The last month has been jarring as Trump continues his crusade against diversity and inclusion. But there are also prominent companies standing their ground—Costco and Apple are defending their DEI programs, and we need Target to join them.^2 Target has a real chance to be a leader in this moment and do what\\'s right. [ ]Tens of thousands of us have already raised our voices to demand that Target bring back its DEI efforts and continue investing in initiatives that support underrepresented communities, minority-owned businesses, and inclusive hiring practices. Will you add your name to join us? Even the daughters of Target co-founder Bruce Dayton have expressed concerns about the direction of the company, stating: \"We are alarmed how quickly the business community has given in to the current administration\\'s retaliatory threats.\"^3 Target marketed itself as a company that celebrated the diversity of its workers, creators, and customers. It\\'s unacceptable for executives to profit off of our communities one minute and then abandon us the next. We deserve better. DEI programs at their core are meant to ensure that businesses like Target are welcoming, fair, and inclusive to the different workers, customers, and public that they interact with. Dayton believed in the \"clear principles of happy customers and strong communities\"—values that Target has now abandoned by choosing to end diversity programs.^4 Equity initiatives transform lives, help companies and communities succeed, and lead to healthier, happier workplaces. It\\'s up to consumers to tell Target we want them to do the right thing—for their business and for us. [ ]Sign the petition and then share this email with 3 friends so we can generate a surge of energy that Target\\'s leadership simply can\\'t ignore. Thanks for all you do. –Garrett N., MoveOn member P.S. Check out my earlier email below for details on the evidence behind these critical programs. Sources: 1. \"Target Went All In on D.E.I.; Its Sudden Pullback Has Black Sellers Reeling,\" The New York Times, February 5, 2025 2. \"Companies like Costco and Apple are defending their DEI programs despite nationwide pushback—These are the companies standing by their policies,\" Fortune, January 29, 2025 3. \"Target cofounder\\'s daughters \\'shocked and dismayed\\' at retailer\\'s DEI rollback,\" Business Insider, February 13, 2025 4. Ibid. -------------------------------------------------------------------------- [ ]Target is rolling back inclusivity programs—sign the petition to tell Target\\'s leadership to uphold its commitment to DEI! Dear fellow MoveOn member, For years, Target has been a leader in corporate responsibility, championing initiatives designed to empower small businesses, increase Black representation in the workforce, and make its customers feel seen. These programs aren\\'t just good for people—they\\'re also good for business. Target was one of the most outspoken supporters of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts. But now, Target leadership is suddenly backtracking on their commitment to these programs. Target\\'s past pledges—like increasing Black workforce representation by 20%, supporting minority-owned suppliers, and donating to social justice causes—have positively impacted countless lives.^5 Donald Trump has been targeting DEI efforts since Day 1 in office, and by caving to his divisive threats, Target is betraying the very customers who have supported its success. [ ]When companies invest in DEI, they invest in people. Now\\'s the time for Target to stand firm in its values, not retreat. Will you add your name to call on Target\\'s leadership to reinstate its DEI programs? Tell Target: Uphold your commitment to inclusion and reinstate DEI programs! [6]Sign the petition In 2020, Target CEO Brian Cornell said George Floyd\\'s murder by police, which took place just 10 minutes from Target\\'s headquarters, had a personal impact on him and Target employees.^6 This ignited a cascade of actions at the company to \"advance racial equity,\" including establishing an executive Racial Equity Action and Change committee to \"focus specifically on how we can drive lasting impact\" for Black employees and customers.^7 In the five years that have followed, Target\\'s DEI initiatives have transformed lives. Employees have found opportunities to grow their careers in inclusive environments, customers have felt valued through inclusive marketing campaigns, and minority-owned businesses have thrived thanks to supplier diversity programs. The evidence behind these programs is overwhelming: *Diverse companies perform better. Organizations with inclusive teams are 70% more likely to capture new markets.^8 *Consumers care about corporate values. Studies show 76% of consumers prefer brands that commit to social equity.^9 *Employees thrive in inclusive workplaces. Scaling back DEI leads to lower morale, higher turnover, and lost talent.^10 [ ]Sign the petition now to tell Target\\'s CEO and board of directors: Reinstate your critical DEI programs and take a stand for inclusion. This doesn\\'t end with Target; it\\'s about a larger fight against corporate backpedaling on inclusivity programs. Across the country, prominent businesses from Amazon to Walmart are scaling back or ending their commitments to DEI, caving to pressure from conservative activists and, now, the White House.^11 It\\'s up to us to send a clear message that inclusivity isn\\'t optional, and companies that abandon DEI will be held accountable by customers who are paying attention. By signing the petition, you\\'re joining our call for Target to: 1.Fully reinstate its DEI programs with transparency about progress toward these goals 2.Publicly reaffirm its commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion as the company\\'s core values 3.Continue investing in initiatives that support underrepresented communities, minority-owned businesses, and inclusive hiring practices [ ]If you agree, add your name to the petition now. By standing together, we can remind Target that their commitment to diversity isn\\'t just good business—it\\'s about doing what\\'s right. Thanks for all you do. –Garrett N., MoveOn member Sources: 5. \"Target was one of the most outspoken supporters of DEI. It\\'s changed its tune,\" CNN, February 3, 2025 6.

       "  'body': 'View this post on the web at video [ ] is emerging as a valuable tool on Substack, offering creators a new way to connect with their audience and build their creative business. Now many creators are making Live Video a regular part of their programming [ ]. Substackers such as Joanna Goddard and Dan Harris are launching recurring live shows, joining others who cover topics from cooking to politics to sports.With more publishers experimenting with this format, we’ve rounded up a few quick lessons about how to host a live show that builds community and grows your business—simply by talking into your phone.Learn more: How to go live [ ]We aim to provide a comprehensive set of tools for publishers across mediums, adding value for subscribers and expanding audiences within and beyond the Substack network. Even if video isn’t usually your preferred medium, it might pay to explore—our data shows that writers and creators who use video grow their revenue 2.5 times as fast as those who don’t.Whether you’re interested in experimenting or ready to build a regular live show, now is a great time to give it a try. Here are a few tips to help you make it happen.Launching your own live video show1. Try going live—then make it a habitGetting comfortable with live video is the first step toward making it a valuable part of your content strategy. Start by going live a few times to experiment with the format, engage with your audience in real time, and see what resonates. Once you’ve tested the waters, we recommend establishing a regular schedule of livestreams. When your audience knows when to tune in, it builds consistency, strengthens engagement, and creates community.Start by going live once a week and informing your subscribers via a dedicated Substack post so they know what to expect. MeidasTouch Network ’s announcement about their new show, Meidas Meet Up [ ], is a good example.Subscribers can tune in to watch your live videos from the app or on their desktop computers. If you’d like to maximize viewership while adding value for paid subscribers, you can keep the live video open to everyone while making the live chat within it exclusive to paid subscribers [ ], like Jessica Reed Kraus [ ] did during her conversation with Meghan McCain. This can offer another revenue stream and foster an exclusive community experience.2. Leverage collaborations to build a guest listCollaborations are a powerful growth tool that allow you to access the Substack network, introduce your work to new audiences, and grow your subscriber base. By inviting fellow creators to stream with you, you’re tapping into their community while offering your subscribers fresh perspectives and dynamic conversations.Looking for collaborators? Revisit publishers you’ve worked with in the past. Checking your audience overlap [ ] can also help identify valuable collaboration opportunities: it shows publications with the same subscribers on their email list, letting you spot potential partners. To explore these insights, go to Stats in your dashboard and select Subscriber Report.Since joining Substack, Jim Acosta has seen incredible growth by going live daily with other publishers. He’s even brought friends and colleagues onto the platform—many of whom weren’t on Substack before. After creating an account, they were able to jump straight into engaging discussions.Whether it’s a guest interview, a panel discussion, or a casual conversation, streaming with others can elevate your content, foster meaningful interactions, and attract new subscribers.“Live video on Substack brings newsmakers and influential voices together in a way we haven’t seen before on other platforms. I recommend inviting guests to join your live videos, whether they are established voices on Substack or new to the platform, as it is an excellent way to grow your audience and produce content your subscribers will love.” —Jim Acosta2. Post the recordingAfter your live session ends, the recording is automatically saved as a draft in your Substack posts. To make publishing even easier, we’ve introduced automated enhancements, which refine your recorded live video by trimming dead space at the beginning, enhancing audio and video quality, and reformatting the layout into a polished side-by-side view. This ensures that your video looks professional and is ready to share with minimal effort.Tyler Dunne goes live to break down the latest NFL news, then shares the recording so his community can keep the discussion going, even if they missed it live.3. Share clips on social media (and Notes)Maximize your reach by sharing short clips from your live video. Substack automatically generates ready-to-post highlights, making it easy to share with just a few clicks. Posting these clips on Notes, X, Instagram, and TikTok will help attract new subscribers and drive engagement back to your Substack publication.Learn more: How to create a clip [ ]Caroline Chambers shared a clip from her cooking demo on Notes, while Irene Kim (김애린) posted a highlight from her conversation with Kelly Williams on Instagram.4. Coming soon: Live video scheduling and RSVP emailsWe’re constantly improving the live video experience, and soon you’ll be able to schedule live sessions in advance and send RSVP emails to your audience. This will help you build anticipation and maximize attendance for your events.Substack Live Video is one of many tools we’re building to help writers and creators deepen their connection with their audience. Whether you’re hosting interviews with fellow Substackers, engaging subscribers in live Q&As, or sharing behind-the-scenes moments, live video makes it easy to bring your work to life in new ways. Even if you don’t typically use video, live shows offer a fresh way to engage with your audience that fits seamlessly into your existing workflow.To help you get started, we’re hosting a virtual masterclass covering best practices and key features for launching your own live show. This session is open to all creators and will take place on Zoom on Wednesday, March 19, from 2 to 3 p.m. ET. Sign up below to join!Unsubscribe ',\n",

       "  'body': \"GenAI and Machine Learning By Vincent GranvilleBy Vincent Granville Read this article on LinkedIn to join the conversationRead on LinkedIn In my recent research on cracking the deepest mathematical mystery, with version 2.0 published yesterday and available here as paper 51, I paved the way to solve a famous multi-century old math conjecture. The question is whether or not the digits of numbers such as π are evenly distributed. Currently, no one knows if the proportion of '1' even exists in these binary digit expansions. It could oscillate forever between 0% and 100% without ever converging. Of course, mathematicians believe that it is 50% in all cases. Trillions of digits have been computed for various constants, and they pass all randomness tests. In this article, I offer a new framework to solve this mystery once for all, for the number e. Dynamics of the digit counting function, seed leading to number e Rather than a closure on this topic, it is a starting point opening new research directions in several fields. Applications include cryptography, dynamical systems, quantum dynamics, high performance computing, LLMs to answer difficult math questions, and more. The highly innovative approach involves iterated self-convolutions of strings and working with numbers as large as 2^n + 1 at power 2^n, with n larger than 100,000 (versus 10,000 in the original version). No one before has ever analyzed the digits of such titanic numbers! To read the full article, participate in the AI challenge to test reasoning, math and pattern detection capabilities of LLMs, get the Python code, read about ground-breaking research, and see all the applications, follow this link. If you already looked at the Python code in version 1.0, note that the new version is 10 times faster with the Gmpy2 library, and now handles numbers even far bigger. I also tested it with different seeds, one of them producing the dynamics shown in the picture below, leading to chaos in much fewer iterations, making it more suitable for cryptography.

[ ]Interview with Timescale AI’s Product Lead on Enhancing AI-Driven DatabasesInterview with Timescale’s AI Product Lead on Enhancing AI-Driven Databases [ ]AI Headlines: Week of 2/17Helix: Revolutionizing Humanoid Robotics at FigureTaken from Figure AI [ ], February 22, 2025.Figure AI captured headlines this last week with Helix [ ], a groundbreaking Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model for humanoid robots, potentially transforming the field of embodied AI. The “generalist” model runs on low-power embedded GPUs for real-world applications, including household chores like sorting groceries to use in logistics and manufacturing lines [ ].Helix works by combining visual data and language prompts to control a robot in real time [ ]. It can process both visual inputs and voice commands simultaneously, allowing robots to respond to and execute tasks without relying on extensive pre-programming.Helix\\'s key technical advancements include:Unified perception, language understanding, and learned controlDecoupled architecture with \"slow\" high-level thinking and \"fast\" real-time executionSingle neural network for all behaviors without task-specific fine-tuningFigure AI, now valued at $39.5 billion after a recent funding round, terminated its partnership with OpenAI [ ] as of this month to focus on in-house technology. The company generated the VLA by collecting about 500 hours of high-quality, multi-robot, multi-operator dataset of diverse teleoperated behaviors.As Helix continues to develop, it could significantly impact various industries, potentially reshaping human-robot interaction and the future of AI-powered robotics. However, experts note [ ] that while the demonstrations show impressive potential, there is cautious optimism about its applicability beyond controlled environments, and significant advancements are still needed before commercial deployment becomes a reality.Microsoft\\'s Majorana 1: A Quantum Leap in Computing?Taken from Quantum Insider [ ], February 22, 2025.Microsoft has unveiled Majorana 1 [ ], the world\\'s first quantum chip powered by a new Topological Core architecture, marking a significant milestone [ ] in quantum computing. This palm-sized processor features 8 qubits made from \\'topoconductors\\', a new class of materials, with the company reportedly saying [ ] that it has the elements to scale to 1 million qubits in the future.“Most of us grew up learning there are three main types of matter that matter: solid, liquid, and gas. Today, that changed [ ],” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in a post on X [ ]. “We believe this breakthrough will allow us to create a truly meaningful quantum computer not in decades, as some have predicted, but in years.”Key applications [ ] of this breakthrough technology could include:Solving the difficult chemistry problem of why certain materials corrode or crackCalculating the properties of catalysts to sustainably break down pollutants or plasticsHarnessing enzymes to boost soil fertility and increase yields to eliminate global hungerWhile NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang said we are 20 years [ ] from practical quantum computing for enterprises, breakthroughs like this have the potential to speed up the timeline dramatically.From Hype to Shutdown: Humane Acquired by HPTaken from InvogueSolutions [ ], February 22, 2025.Humane, the Bay Area start up that raised over $230 million for its Ai pin, announced its shutdown and sale to HP [ ] on February 19.Industry experts [ ] have called the shutdown as the “first high-profile startup flop of the artificial intelligence era.” Just under one year after the product’s November 2023 launch [ ], and despite an initial valuation of $850 million, HP Inc. has reportedly acquired Humane’s assets and team for approximately $116 million [ ].Here’s a quick timeline of Humane’s historic rise and fall:April 2024: Humane launches [ ] the AI Pin with significant hypeOctober 2024: Price dropped [ ] from $699 to $499February 19, 2025: Humane announces shutdownFebruary 28, 2025, 12:00 PM PST: All Humane AI Pins will cease to functionHumane was founded by former Apple executives Imran Chaudhri and Bethany Bongiorno [ ]. Once named a Time [ ] magazine best invention of the year, the Ai Pin disappointed users who complained about malfunctions, its high price, and overheating problems.Events Spotlight🏛️ DC: AI Soirée and the Human Alignment QuestionThe first-ever GenAI Collective AI Soirée in DC brought together 20 attendees to explore one critical question: How do we align AI when we can’t even align ourselves? In an intimate setting, participants engaged in thought-provoking discussions on AI acceleration vs. safety, humanoid robots, artificial emotional intelligence, and humanity\\'s increasing dependency on AI.Key moments included a spirited debate between Wolf Ruzicka and Ed Melick on whether AI development should speed ahead or slow down. The consensus? There was none: except that these conversations are more necessary than ever. With curated roundtable discussions and reflections, attendees left with deeper insights and a renewed curiosity about AI’s societal role.A huge thank you to our hosts and organizers: Nathaniel Burola, Anna D\\'Aprile, Liel Zino, Maxwell Stern, Pranav Velleleth, Kyra B., Rin Nguyen, and Samuel Li. More AI Soirées to come!🌁 SF Bay Area: DeepSeek for FoundersNo pitches, no buzzwords, just real conversations. The GenAI Collective\\'s DeepSeek for Founders event in San Francisco provided a space for builders and problem-solvers to discuss how open-source AI can drive real impact. Hosted by Chappy and Mary in a stunning venue overlooking the city, the gathering felt more like a conversation among friends than a traditional startup event.Founders broke into small groups to share strategies, lessons learned, and practical insights on integrating AI, reducing costs, and navigating the evolving landscape. The relaxed yet high-energy atmosphere fostered genuine connections and left attendees excited about what’s next.🌆 Chicago: How AI Is Innovating the Physical WorldChicago’s AI community came together at mHUB for an electrifying discussion on AI’s impact on datacenters and robotics.

If you missed it, keep an eye out for future mHUB events!Partner SpotlightTimescale [ ]: Redefining AI Integration for the Modern DeveloperIn an insightful conversation on the GenAI Collective podcast Collective Intelligence, host Thomas Joshi interviewed Avthar Sewrathan, AI Product Lead at Timescale. The discussion revolved around how Timescale is revolutionizing AI integration by extending PostgreSQL capabilities, eliminating the need for separate vector databases. Sewrathan detailed how PGVector Scale and PG AI are streamlining AI-powered data retrieval and enhancing developer experience.Bridging AI and Databases During the interview, Joshi posed the fundamental question: “What challenges are developers facing when integrating AI with databases?” Sewrathan responded: “Developers need AI applications that provide reliable, accurate answers while avoiding the headache of managing separate systems.”Joshi explored the limitations of vector databases, asking: “Why would developers prefer extending PostgreSQL rather than adopting a specialized vector database?” Sewrathan explained, “Managing a separate vector database requires additional infrastructure, synchronization, and learning a new query language. Our goal is to let developers use the tools they already know and love while minimizing infrastructure complexity.”By extending PostgreSQL with PGVector Scale and PG AI, Timescale enables AI-powered applications to operate seamlessly within existing relational databases.Key Offerings Timescale\\'s latest innovations address major AI application challenges:PGVector Scale – Enhances PostgreSQL’s vector search performance, handling billions of embeddings efficiently.PG AI – Automates embedding creation and synchronization, reducing maintenance burdens.Vectorizer – Ensures real-time updates, keeping applications up to date.“These tools make AI integration smoother and more scalable without requiring developers to switch to an entirely new database,” Sewrathan emphasized.By combining PostgreSQL’s stability with advanced AI capabilities, Timescale empowers developers to build scalable, AI-driven applications without unnecessary complexity. With PGVector Scale and PG AI, Timescale strengthens its position as a leader in AI-driven database solutions, paving the way for the next generation of AI applications.Learn more about PG AI [ ] and subscribe to the Collective Intelligence podcast here [ ].Join the Community! 💬 Slack: GenAI Collective [ ]𝕏 Twitter / X: @GenAICollective [ ]🧑\\u200d💼 LinkedIn: The GenAI Collective [ ]📸 Instagram: @GenAICollective [ ]🎙️ Collective Intelligence Podcast [ ]🌎 Start a Chapter [ ]👷 Join the Team [ ]Want to feature your insights?

       "  'body': 'Strategy for beginners, how Starbucks lost its soul, and a food safety pointer (Issue #274)The Medium Newsletter ( newsletter byThe Medium Blog ( 24, 2025∙4 min read∙View on Medium ( anyone ever asked you to \"be more strategic\"? Here\\'s what that meansStrategy for beginners, how Starbucks lost its soul, and a food safety pointer (Issue #274)\"Being told you need to be more strategic is common feedback for senior engineers,\" writes CTO and technical advisor Dan Pupius ( on Medium. (He was Medium\\'s Head of Engineering a decade ago.)It\\'s a phrase I\\'ve heard a lot throughout my career, and it\\'s usually thrown around without a precise definition. The gist seems to be to work smarter, not harder, but it\\'s unclear how to apply that phrase to the messiness of inbound emails and Slacks, some of which might simply require hard work.For some background, I dug through the Medium archive and found this story ( by product designer Stephanie Irwin ( Irwin draws a clear distinction between a plan and a strategy. A plan is basically a to-do list, but a strategy is a set of choices that position you in a way to win. Or, in the words of Pupius, strategy is \"a framework that guides decision making.\" If you\\'re doing it right, you\\'ll have defined your priorities in advance, giving yourself permission to say no to work that doesn\\'t serve your goals.And if you\\'re not strategic? As Irwin explains, \"You may feel incredibly busy, yet months pass… and that dream or goal you have still hasn\\'t happened.\"Pupius\\'s example: You\\'re an engineer whose product seems to be getting buggier (that\\'s not great) and you want to catch issues before they hit production. An easy, not-super-strategic solution? Simply add more tests and/or a manual QA phase. A better, more strategic path: End-to-end automated tests of critical user flows. This gives you a framework for understanding what kinds of tests you want to add, and how you\\'ll prioritize them.For a far deeper dive into the decades (centuries, even!) of meaning hidden behind that \"be more strategic\" comment you might hear during a performance review, I recommend spending some time with Roger Martin ( Medium archive ( He\\'s written a book on this topic (Playing to Win)\\u200a-\\u200aand, in this brief history ( traces business strategy all the way back to a 1911 Harvard Business School course on military strategy ( In both military and business contexts, as Martin points out, the art is to achieve a sense of equilibrium (peace, basically) between yourself and your competitors. You want to \"get your desired positioning and have your competitors largely satisfied with theirs\\u200a-\\u200ato create as positive-sum a game as circumstances allow.\"- Harris Sockel☕ Your responses to our newsletter about \"third places\" (and Starbucks)Last Thursday, we sent a newsletter about Starbucks\\' attempt to reclaim its position as America\\'s go-to coffee shop and \"third place\" (a zone of connectedness and community between work and home). Many of you responded thoughtfully, on both Starbucks\\' business prospects (it\\'s not doing well lately) and the importance of \"third places.\" Here are a few responses that stood out to us:I lived in Seattle when Starbucks was in its early days ( It still had a \"3rd Place\" vibe then, but I had a front seat to the changes. IMHO, the two biggest things Starbucks did to ruin the brand:1) Replace skillful baristas with push-button, automated espresso machines, eliminating the art and know-how of pulling espresso. This created an army of \"fake baristas\" and removed the craft from the coffee. […]2) Centralized and standardized food offerings. This is the biggest reason I tend to avoid Starbucks. Their food looks anemic, generic, and totally unappealing. In the old days, they contracted with local bakeries and vendors and had quality items that varied somewhat among stores. Now, it all comes in shrink-wrapped from a central hub.[…] As with so many businesses they let \"efficiency\" and the bean counters steer decisions that have impacted their brand for the worse.\\u200a-\\u200aA. Wyatt ( to reclaim the community/coffeehouse vibe ( is a big lift for a corporation whose actions have consistently degraded that experience over the years. Actions need to align with that aspiration and should be directed within first. Get your house in order before inviting company over. Improving the barista experience will improve the customer experience.\\u200a-\\u200aR. A. Jones ( Some practical wisdomFood expiration dates are confusing because there\\'s no national system. A rule of thumb ( someone should have taught me in elementary school: \"Use by\" is a safety threshold (don\\'t cross it unless you\\'ve frozen the item beforehand); \"Best before\" is a quality threshold (fine to cross if you\\'re okay sacrificing flavor or texture).···Deepen your understanding every day with the Medium Newsletter.

( image: ( # OpenAI thinks we’ll have superintelligent AI by 2027—but Microsoft’s CEO isn’t buying itAlways good to take these things with a grain of salt, _buuut_ OpenAI Chief Product Officer Kevin Weil [apparently thinks]( the company could achieve “ASI” (artificial superintelligence, where AIs can do everything _better_ than humans) by 2027… _if not earlier_.View image: ( image link: ( They must really believe this over there, because according to a [report from The Information]( OpenAI is filling investors in on some_ absolutely wild_ spending plans.**OpenAI is projecting to…*** Spend $13B on Microsoft's servers in 2025 and $28B by 2028.* Burn through $7B this year and $20B by 2027.* Drop $325B on total compute from 2025-2030.* Finally turn profitable after [building Stargate]( (their next-gen compute infrastructure) in 2030.**Here's why that ASI claim is raising eyebrows:**Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella thinks the [exact opposite]( In a [fascinating interview]( Nadella pointed out that we're getting way ahead of ourselves with all this AGI hype.His [take]( “Self-claiming some AGI milestone, that's just nonsensical benchmark hacking to me.”Youtube: Satya Nadella – Microsoft’s AGI Plan & Quantum Breakthrough ( Satya, the real benchmark for AI is GDP growth:** * Right now, developed economies are growing at 2% (_zero_ after inflation).* For AI to match the Industrial Revolution, we'd need to see _7-10% growth._* That would mean an extra _$10 trillion _in value. _Every. Single. Year._Nadella also [explained why]( he believes no single company will dominate AI through one superior model—because open-source will prevent any “winner-take-all” scenario. And even if you build an amazing model, you still need massive infrastructure to run it—storage, compute power, and agent environments across dozens of global regions.As if to twist the knife, he added that you can't serve the world from “one data center in Texas” (_sick Stargate burn_).Because of all this, he said “_one person running away with one model and building it all may not happen,”—_which is basically him throwing cold water on OpenAI's investment thesis. As a reminder, that thesis = OpenAI could “[maybe capture the light cone of all future value in the universe]( by creating AGI. **That said, Nadella's actually thrilled about the coming “**[**overbuild**]( of AI compute capacity in 2027-2028.** As all the tech giants pour [hundreds of billions]( into data centers, Microsoft’s choosing to both build AND [lease a lot]( **Why lease? Because:*** Massive infrastructure buildout will drive prices down. * Like how the [fiber buildouts]( of the dotcom era gave us the internet, today’s data center buildouts could have similar long term benefits. * Countries, not just companies, are racing to deploy compute, too. So while OpenAI is betting everything on superintelligence, Microsoft is preparing for a world where AI becomes a commodity—powered by a mix of open and closed-source models running on globally distributed infrastructure.After all, whether or not superintelligence arrives by 2027, somebody's gotta provide all that compute.

Check it out.-------------------------LAST WEEK\\'S BREAKTHROUGHS-------------------------In last week’s newsletter ( I asked you to let go of a lie you’ve been telling yourself.This hit close to home for Jason:“Your email this week hit on the topic I\\'ve been grappling withfor decades. Graduating high school, I took what many wouldconsider the ‘safe route’ and ignored the things I was passionateabout and felt I was decent at. I told myself I could always comeback to it and do it as a side business or even somedaytransition careers after I\\'ve saved enough for retirement andpaid off my debts. As the years went on I continued to keep thismindset, always viewing my interest as a potential businessopportunity, or my way out of the career I chose that has neverbeen satisfying to me. I\\'ve spent a lot of money over the lasttwo decades on courses, hardware, software, always keeping up todate with programs, and/or any other new trend in the industry Ialways envisioned myself going into. I\\'ve told myself I need tostay serious about it if it will ever happen.Then I got married and had kids. Priorities changed and financeshad to be focused on other areas. New responsibilities took overand the idea of changing careers while my kids are still at homeseemed less and less possible. Over the last three years itstarted to occur to me that it may never happen.Your email about lying to yourself hit me square in the jaw. I\\'vespent so much time, energy, and money on something that Ihonestly never took seriously enough to make that leap. All thewhile I\\'ve had a toxic relationship with my dream, always viewingit as my way out instead of using it as a tool to keep megrounded and present. I had a false sense of perfectionismwhenever I would sit down with it, and it would leave mefrustrated. I never accepted that it could be a hobby, a way forme to escape the stressors and pressures of life, of theday-to-day business that I didn\\'t always enjoy. Instead I wouldlie to myself every time I thought about my interest, reliving myyouth and never letting go of it.I had an overwhelming feeling of finally being able to accept itfor what it truly is. A lie I tell myself over and over again. Ifeel more at peace with the idea of never making that transition.It may very well never become anything more than a hobby, andmaybe that\\'s exactly what it needs to be, and probably what italways should have been.”Letting go of one lie helped Katie become a new person:“I actually discovered a lie last week, it was along the lines ofI’m so tired that I can’t get out of bed early. I allowed mywake-up time to be set by my two pre-school boys and would rollunwillingly, moodily, groggily out of bed when they woke up,immediately having to deal with their hunger demands and morningmoods. Things were tense, angry snappy mum could be around allday and late into the night.Since my mood tends to set the tone for the whole household wewere all a little grumpy and short with each other, me notwanting to engage in the games the kids wanted to play and themnot wanting to do anything I’d ask. I decided one day to get upat 5 A.M. and managed to get nearly three whole hours for myselfbefore anyone else got up, it was magical, I was a differentperson. They became different little people. And I’ve noticed ashift in our whole household over the past two weeks as I’vecontinued it.It’s so simple: go to bed early, wake up early. Take the time formyself at the beginning of the day rather than hoping I might getsome at the end of it (I never did). I actually look forward togetting up each day! I’m getting work done, I’m exercising, thedog gets a walk, I get to see the sunrise, maybe I’m even justwatching a movie—it doesn’t matter, it’s a slice of my day that’ssolely for me.”To end, a reader with a recent break-up is finally acknowledgingthe truth:“I\\'ve been telling myself and my therapist for a long time nowthat I\\'m fine, I\\'m doing well, I\\'m good at being on my own. Andwhilst in the past this has been true, three months postbreak-up, I realize that I am lonely, not just alone. That I misshaving companionship and connection and silly little in-jokes andthat my aliveness and exploration have tanked.It feels very vulnerable and raw to be this honest that I\\'mmissing something and that I feel like an island.You\\'re right that true growth is acknowledging this, honoring thefeelings of grief and isolation, yet reaching out to friends andformulating a plan to cultivate a stronger platonic socialcircle, rather than romance-based.”As always, send your breakthroughs by simply replying to thisemail.

That applies to startups, AI, and even Business Intelligence. The problem? Too many tools, too much data chaos, and too little strategy. The solution? AI-driven insights _done right_. This week, we’re diving into BI evolution, AI’s biggest bottlenecks, and how AI agents are quietly reshaping industries. **Let’s get to it!**What’s old is new again and Paul Graham hits the nail on the proverbial head when he snarkley shares that understanding our users’ problems has and continues to be the most important component of starting a startup or IMHO creating any product.Tweet: ( Here’s Why Over 4 Million Professionals Read Morning BrewView image: ( image link: ( * Business news explained in plain English* Straight facts, zero fluff, & plenty of puns* 100% free[See for yourself]( image: ( # ~**Let’s Get To It!**~----------View image: ( image link: ( View image: ( Welcome, To 8 bits for a Byte!# Here\\'s what caught my eye in the world of AI this week:View image: ( 1. **The Evolution of BI & the AI-First Future**.**Bit #1: Business Intelligence Never Stands Still**BI has evolved from rigid IT-controlled systems to flexible, self-service tools—and now, AI-driven analytics. Each wave solved old problems while creating new ones. The challenge today? Too many tools, inconsistent data, and a struggle between governance and self-service..🔹 BI has gone through four major phases—legacy BI (1990s), self-service (2000s), governance-focused (2010s), and AI-driven (2020s)..🔹 Modern BI tools are fragmented, forcing companies to use multiple platforms for governance, exploration, and modeling..🔹 AI is entering BI, but without structured business logic, it struggles to deliver meaningful insights..💡** Actionable Impact:**Leaders should evaluate BI solutions that balance governance with flexibility. Look for AI-powered BI tools that integrate deeply with data models like dbt to maintain accuracy while enabling self-service insights..## **Bit #2: 1990s – The Legacy Era of BI**BI in the 90s was slow, expensive, and IT-controlled, relying on tools like SAP BusinessObjects, IBM Cognos, and Oracle BI. Reports were pre-aggregated in OLAP cubes, making changes time-consuming and inflexible..🔹 Strength: High governance and structured reporting..🔹 Challenge: High costs, slow report generation, and dependence on IT for insights..🔹 Reports were often outdated due to overnight ETL processes, limiting real-time decision-making..💡** Actionable Impact:** If your organization still relies on legacy BI, it’s time to modernize. Moving to cloud-native BI platforms enables real-time analytics, scalability, and faster decision-making..## **Bit #3: 2000s – The Self-Service Revolution**BI tools like Tableau, Power BI, and Qlik democratized data access, allowing business users to analyze data visually—no IT required..🔹 Strength: Faster insights and intuitive interfaces..🔹 Challenge: Data chaos—no centralized governance led to conflicting reports..🔹 Data extracts often became outdated, causing inconsistencies across teams..💡** Actionable Impact:** If self-service BI led to data silos in your company, implement centralized data governance using modern modeling layers like dbt or LookML..## **Bit #4: 2010s – The Return of Governance & Modern Data Modeling**With cloud data warehouses like Snowflake and BigQuery, BI shifted toward governance-focused platforms like Looker. dbt emerged as a key transformation tool, enabling SQL-based data modeling..🔹 Strength: Centralized governance and scalable cloud analytics..🔹 Challenge: Bottlenecks—data teams controlled models, slowing self-service..🔹 Companies adopted hybrid BI workflows, mixing dbt, Looker, Tableau, and Sigma..💡** Actionable Impact:** If BI feels fragmented, consolidate workflows by defining clear governance policies and choosing BI tools that integrate directly with your transformation layer..## **Bit #5: 2020s – The AI-First BI Landscape**BI today is fragmented, with companies using multiple tools for different needs—leading to inefficiencies. AI is emerging as a game-changer, but without structured business logic, it falls short..🔹 Strength: AI-powered analytics, automation, and embedded intelligence..🔹 Challenge: Too many BI tools, inconsistent metrics, and lack of a single source of truth..🔹 Traditional BI vendors (Looker, Tableau, Power BI) have slowed innovation due to acquisitions..💡** Actionable Impact:** Look for BI platforms that unify governance, flexibility, and AI-driven insights, reducing reliance on multiple tools while maintaining accuracy..## **Bit #6: The Rise of Next-Gen BI Vendors**New players like **Omni** and **Inventive** are addressing BI’s biggest challenges—merging governance with AI-powered automation..🔹 **Omni** combines deep data modeling with self-service, enabling flexible, governed analytics..🔹 **Inventive** is revolutionizing embedded analytics with AI-powered agents that automate report generation and customer interactions..🔹 Both are reshaping BI by integrating with modern data stacks (dbt, cloud warehouses) for seamless workflows..💡** Actionable Impact:** Explore emerging BI solutions that consolidate analytics, reduce SQL dependency, and enhance AI-driven decision-making..## **Bit #7: AI is Transforming BI—But Needs Structure**Text-to-SQL and AI copilots are making BI more accessible, but they rely on structured business logic to provide accurate insights..🔹 AI can automate data queries, but without a well-defined data model, results may be inconsistent..🔹 Governance remains critical—AI should assist decision-making, not create data chaos..🔹 The future of BI blends AI-powered automation with strong data modeling to ensure trustworthy insights..💡** Actionable Impact:** Ensure your AI-driven BI tools are backed by a structured semantic layer to maintain data accuracy and consistency..## **Bit #8: The Future of BI – AI-First, But Governed**BI is shifting towards AI-driven automation, but structured data models remain essential for reliable insights. The leaders behind Looker’s success are now building the AI-first BI era, ensuring governance doesn’t get left behind..🔹 AI is making BI more intuitive, but unstructured AI-driven queries risk generating misleading insights..🔹 The next generation of BI will integrate AI with strong governance, enabling both automation and accuracy..🔹 Companies that adopt AI-first BI while maintaining data governance will gain a competitive advantage..💡** Actionable Impact:** Adopt BI solutions that prioritize AI-driven insights _and_ structured governance—ensuring both speed and accuracy in decision-making..**Final Thought:** The future of BI isn’t just AI—it’s AI + structured data. Leaders who embrace AI-powered governance will drive the next wave of data-driven success.View image: ( # Quote of the weekView image: ( 2. I deeply resonate with this quote from[ Fei-Fei Li]( — it perfectly captures the essence of how AI should be approached. AI is not here to replace human intelligence but to enhance it, serving as a powerful tool to amplify creativity, problem-solving, and innovation..This understanding is _crucial_ for successfully implementing AI solutions for customers. Too often, organizations view AI as merely an automation tool, missing its potential to unlock new opportunities, insights, and human potential. When we integrate AI thoughtfully—aligning it with our values, strategy, and vision—we don’t just optimize processes; we empower people, foster innovation, and drive meaningful transformation. AI, when used right, is not just about efficiency—it’s about elevating human ingenuity to new heights.View image: ( View image: ( image link: ( 3. [Cracking the Code of Business Leadership]( love the clarity and structure in [Timothy T Tiryaki, PhD ]( breakdown! He has distilled the essence of business leadership into a strategic framework that is simple, actionable and insightful.**A few thoughts:**1️⃣ **The North Star as a Competitive Advantage** – Many organizations chase revenue and profitability but neglect the organizational engine that sustains them. Companies that invest in culture, leadership, and systems thinking often outperform competitors in the long run.2️⃣ **AI as an Enabler Across All Three Areas** – AI isn’t just for optimizing operations (bottom-line growth); it’s also transforming business models (top-line growth) and reshaping leadership and culture (organizational capabilities). Strategic AI adoption could be the key to full integration.3️⃣ **From Systems Thinking to Systems Being** – Love this phrase! It highlights that leadership isn’t just about understanding complexity but embodying it. The best leaders don’t just \"manage\" systems—they create an ecosystem where strategy, people, and performance thrive together.Curious—how do you see AI playing into the development of organizational capabilities? Many leaders see AI as just an efficiency tool, but I think it can be a powerful enabler of leadership and culture too.View image: ( View image: ( image link: ( 4. [AI as a Force Multiplier: Unlocking Business Potential]( are increasingly investing in AI to enhance operations and boost business outcomes. However, many struggle to realize AI\\'s full potential due to bureaucratic constraints and skill gaps. Emphasizing collaboration between AI and human workers can unlock greater efficiency and innovation.## **Bit: Why isn’t AI delivering its full promise?**AI is a game-changer, but many organizations fail to realize its full potential due to bureaucracy, skill gaps, and outdated workflows. Instead of replacing humans, AI should act as a **force multiplier**, amplifying human capabilities and accelerating business outcomes.### **Key Takeaways:**🔹 **Augmentation, Not Automation** – The most successful AI implementations **enhance** human work rather than replace it. Organizations focusing on AI to reduce headcount often see low ROI.🔹 **AI Multiplier Effect** – AI can **increase efficiency and innovation** by 1.2x to 3.2x, but **only if businesses remove organizational constraints** like slow decision-making and rigid budgeting.🔹 **Overcoming Barriers** – Common AI roadblocks include **poor data quality, excessive bureaucracy, lack of AI trust, and skill gaps**. Fixing these allows AI to drive real business value.### **Action Plan: What You Can Do Today**✅ **Help Employees Work Effectively with AI** – Invest in **AI training**, including **prompt engineering and AI-augmented decision-making**.✅ **Fix Workflows to Remove AI Barriers** – Identify **bottlenecks** like slow approvals and rigid processes that **prevent AI from scaling**.✅ **Adopt Agile Funding Models** – Move beyond **static budgets** and enable **dynamic funding** to quickly seize AI-driven opportunities.**Final Thought:** AI isn’t a magic fix—it’s a tool. Organizations that optimize workflows, empower employees, and rethink governance will unlock AI’s true potential. **Are you ready to compete at the speed of AI?** 🚀The[ Business Agility Institute (BAI)]( is a pioneering research and advocacy organization dedicated to transforming businesses for the future.

Strategic MindsetI had the chance to organize a book club on _Testing Business Ideas_, led by none other than [David Bland]( himself. Total game-changer! It opened my eyes to just how efficiently—and affordably—you can test ideas before going all in. This is a fantastic framework for resilient leadership! It highlights the shift from execution-focused thinking to outcome-driven decision-making. Here are three key takeaways that reinforce the importance of digging deeper:### **Key Takeaways:**🔹 **Challenge Assumptions** – Don’t just build what was requested; question if it should be built at all. The real risk isn’t execution—it’s irrelevance.🔹 **Validate with Evidence** – Customer requests should be examined through the lens of actual needs, not taken as orders. Seek proof, not just opinions.🔹 **Measure the Right Things** – Success isn’t just hitting deadlines and budgets. Reducing risk, learning faster, and making better bets drive long-term impact.### **Actionable Impact:**Shifting your team’s mindset from **\"Are we doing this right?\"** to **\"Are we doing the right thing?\"** is a critical mindset in the 21st century that corporations must have to win the AI battle. Winning organizations will thrive on evidence, adaptability, and smart risk-taking. 🚀View image: ( Until next time, take it one bit at a time!RobThank you for scrolling all the way to the end!

Berkeley Alumni Virtual Book Club Spring is just around the corner! Kick off the new season and rejuvenate your reading list by joining the Berkeley Alumni Virtual Book Club, where we explore a wide range of themes and diverse voices. If you'd like to engage online with fellow Berkeley reading enthusiasts, no matter your location or schedule, then this asynchronous book club is for you! Our next reading period begins March 14 with The Ride of Her Life by Elizabeth Letts. The Ride of Her Life: The True Story of a Woman, Her Horse, and Their Last-Chance Journey Across America is an inspirational tale of individualism and community, set against the backdrop of a rapidly changing society. In 1954, with no money, no family, and a dire medical prognosis, 63-year old Maine farmer Annie Wilkins sets off on horseback to fulfill her bucket list of traveling across the continent to see the Pacific Ocean. At a time when country backroads are giving way to interstates, small towns are being overshadowed by growing cities, and solo female travelers are a rarity, Annie's horseback quest presents a wide range of challenges, a vast array of supporters and doubters, and the opportunity to experience the full spectrum of 1950s America. Join our free, online forum today. We connect through an exclusive online forum -- available to you at all times, and moderated by a professional book club manager -- offering a private space for members to discuss the book in depth. With a new selection every two months, we sample a wide array of works, both fiction and nonfiction, including some by UC Berkeley alumni and faculty.The next reading period begins Friday, March 14. Grab a copy of The Ride of Her Life from your local library or your favorite book retailer and join us on our reading journey! LEARN MORE!

After just one week of our \"Nobody Elected Elon\" campaign, Trump released an official statement that Musk has \"no actual or formal authority to make government decisions.\"^1 Instead of backing down, we must double down. If we can raise the money, we will secure alternative billboard locations in key areas, create mobile billboard trucks that can\\'t be censored, and could even develop digital ad campaigns that billboard companies can\\'t block. The billboards are working. Let\\'s show them that attempts to silence us will only make us louder.

They\\'ve already validated it works through [actual laboratory experiments]( how it works.** AI Co-Scientist acts like a collaborative research partner, using a coalition of specialized AI agents that:* Generate novel research hypotheses.* Evaluate them through simulated scientific debates.* Refine ideas through tournaments and evolution.* Use web search and other tools to fact-check claims.* Break complex problems into testable sub-components.Unlike other “AI for science” tools that just summarize existing research, this one aims to uncover genuinely new scientific knowledge.Google says the tool is meant to assist scientists, not replace them (_hence the “co”)_.

       "  'body': ' [ ]SIGN: To President Zelenskyy, from embarrassed Americans! Dear MoveOn member, My name is John Pavlovitz and I\\'m an author and activist. Like you and much of the nation, I watched last week\\'s shamefulconfrontation between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, President Donald Trump, and Vice President JD Vanceunfold. And now, President Trump is suspending military aid to Ukraine, a devastating and disastrous move that will hurt the Ukrainian people the most.^1I feel both tremendous grief and fierce anger witnessing our leadership\\'s abhorrent treatment of President Zelenskyy. On Friday, I immediately took to my Substack to express what was in my heart, and tens of thousands read and shared it on their social media profiles. As much grief and anger I was feeling, I was in equal force inspired by our collective compassion and care. As I saw the massive expression of affinity from around the nation and the world, I wanted to take action so that we, the people, could show and express our unified support for President Zelenskyy and solidarity with the Ukrainian people. [ ]I launched an open letter to President Zelenskyy, and in the first 72 hours, it amassed more than 31,000 signatures. Will you add your name? Russian President Vladimir Putin\\'s war against Ukraine has threatened the safety, democracy, and freedom of the Ukrainian people. President Trump and Vice President Vance have shown a complete lack of respect, empathy, and diplomacy. Together, we must make it clear to the Ukrainian people and the world that the actions of our leaders do not represent the American people. Over the past two years, everyday people have been showing up in support of Ukraine in both big demonstrations and small acts—including displaying the Ukrainian flag, publicly advocating for peace and diplomacy, and denouncing the devastation and violence caused by Putin. We cannot allow the indefensible actions of our government to eclipse our overwhelming solidarity. [ ]Add your name to the petition so we can show President Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian people, and global leaders across the world that President Trump and Vice President Vance DO NOT represent us—and that the American people support Ukraine! Add your name to the open letter to demonstrate that the American people are firmly against Donald Trump, JD Vance, and the Republican Party—and that President Zelinskyy and the Ukrainian people have our backing and support! [4]Sign the petition The people of Ukraine deserve sovereignty, safety, and to live freely. And together, we can continue to advocate for that future, and let President Trump and Vice President Vance know that we will not sit back as they bulldoze over world leaders and allies. We demand better. Since last week\\'s meeting,leaders around the world have spoken out to affirm their backing of Ukraine, includingfromthe United Kingdom, France, Germany, Ireland, Canada, Spain, and countlessother nations.^2 It is important that the voices of the American people join in. We do not have to cower to this administration—we can continue to demonstrate our values through our finances, our actions, and our voices. May the Ukrainian people be protected, may their nation endure, and may our nation transcend our leaders so that we can all arrive on the other side of these incredibly dark days in the dawn of a world that will be more compassionate and beautiful than this one. [ ]Ukraine deserves our resistance. We have to fight back against this now or our nation will fall too. Click here to add your name to the petition and then send it to three friends to help spread the word. Thanks for all you do. –John Pavlovitz Sources: 1. \"Why Is Trump Pausing Aid to Ukraine?

So that’s kind of how we started.“ — [Travis Kalanick at Startup School 2012]( vision was to offer **a new way of transportation**, one you could rely on whenever, wherever, at just one click’s distance on your own phone.So what first started as a limo timeshare service (yes, that was the initial idea) later became UberCab, an app to connect drivers and riders across town. **They launched in 2010 in San Francisco**, a city that was well-known for its taxi problem back then. 15 years later, they’re present in pretty much every major city across the country, plus [10,000 more]( around the world. It’s hard to imagine life without Uber today. It’s become one of the main players in the transportation industry without even owning any vehicles or garages. It’s made its way into the [top 100 most valuable public companies]( in the whole world. But all this could only happen after those first few customers.

The referral program included free rides or ‘Uber credits’ to reward users who (you guessed it) referred friends to the app. Not only did this help Uber leverage its existing user base and hopefully bring them back by offering them a good deal, but it was also an easy way to acquire new users at a low cost.* **Rating System: **Even from the start, Uber was known for it. The words ‘rate your trip’, along with five star-shaped buttons would show up on your screen every time you made it to your destination. Had a bad trip? Rate your driver one star and their average rating will lower down for everyone to see. This system really made the difference for passengers in terms of safety, because it gave them some sense of control over the experience that they certainly did not have with traditional cabs. * **Digital Marketing**: If it’s the year 2010 and you’re creating an app that requires people to have a smartphone, chances are those same people are using said smartphone to go on Facebook and Twitter. Uber was smart to invest in targeted advertising and sponsored content on these social media platforms in order to increase their visibility, get people talking and get new customers. * **Reliability**: When it comes to transportation, Uber made it its mission to be the most dependable option out there. That was the main priority even before it all became about the lowest possible fee. To be able to get on your phone, click a few buttons and hop on a car in a matter of minutes was what made the product unique, what offered the most value to any rider considering to try Uber out. “People really loved the fixed pricing, but what they sort of got used to and forgot that is a really bad experience is not being able to get a ride. And so, Uber […] is about always providing the cheapest reliable ride. So we’re always a reliable ride and we will find the cheapest price point to make that happen.“ — Travis Kalanick, [LAUNCH Festival, 2014]( **Word Of Mouth: **At first, the Uber app could be downloaded by anyone, but could only be used to request a ride with specific codes that Travis and Garrett gave to their friends to try out. And so those friends told other friends and pretty soon, [he says]( their inbox was getting full of people who also wanted a code. Guess you should never underestimate the efficiency of good old word of mouth.View image: ( ### KEY TAKEAWAYS* **Uber’s a tech company, not a transportation one**. San Francisco at the time didn’t need more cabs, they just needed to be better connected with passengers. Understanding the difference was key to their early success. There were drivers and there were riders all across town, so they took it upon themselves to build the bridge between them- a digital bridge, that is. It saved them a lot of money to let go of the idea of owning the assets, but focus on handling the logistics instead. * **User-centric Platform:** Nothing beats simplicity and efficiency. From the beginning the Uber app’s purpose was to eliminate as many steps as possible in the process of calling and waiting for a cab. Even the transaction was already accounted for by filling out your credit card information beforehand. That’s [reducing the customer’s journey steps]( to a minimum for an easier, more straightforward experience of getting a ride. Who wouldn’t want that?“[…] The same sort of thing that motivated me with StumbleUpon and Uber, creating a product I personally wanna use. […] I think if you just make the product simple enough and easy enough to use, and it’s valuable enough then it will, you know, potentially be disruptive.“ — Garrett Camp, [Google Zeitgeist]( in 2016* **Exploit Your Biggest Trait**: We’ve talked about Uber’s accesibility already, but arguably not enough. This truly made the world of a difference when trying to persuade taxi’s regulars to switch to Uber. So when you identify the thing that sets you apart in whatever industry you’re trying to take over, you just don’t shut up about it. “Our goal is to get the cheapest ride possible. Why? Because we are trying to become a main stay in the transportation space, and you don’t do that by charging more than you have to. But if you don’t have an option, then we’re losing. Because then we are the same as a taxi company. We need to provide a reliable ride when you can’t get one.“ — Travis Kalanick, [LAUNCH Festival, 2014]( image: ( --------------------Learn more about the Uber story:* [**Travis Kalanick's Relentless Ambition**]( **[All Hail The Uber Man!

       "  'body': ' Dear MoveOn member, We are watching what we never thought possible—the apparent transformation of our democracy into a dictatorship (or, as Trump has promoted, a monarchy with him as king).^1 The battle of our day is no longer about Democrats versus Republicans or left versus right. The choice right now is democracy or dictatorship. And we\\'re sliding faster than I ever thought possible into the latter. Everyone must choose which side they\\'re on. You may be feeling helpless, powerless, and alone. But you are not. Most Americans are as disgusted by this as you are. Trump and his billionaire friends want us to feel helpless, powerless, and alone—because that\\'s how Trump will take over. But tyranny cannot prevail over people who refuse to succumb to it. And something is beginning to happen. Boycotts are taking hold. Protests are on the rise. Federal courts are hitting back. The Trump-Musk-Vance regime\\'s popularity is plunging, and DOGE is losing credibility. In these dark times, people are starting to fight back. Ultimately, what happens to our country will come down to our own courage and resolve: To engage in peaceful protest. To organize and mobilize others. To work against hate and bigotry. To fight for justice and democracy. That\\'s why I\\'m writing to you today to ask you to support MoveOn, an organization I deeply admire and that has millions of members in every corner of our country. MoveOn can reach, train, support, organize, and communicate at a scale that is unparalleled in the progressive movement, and it does so with cutting-edge technology. We need MoveOn in this moment, now more than ever. Will you join me in starting a monthly donation of$5 to MoveOn to help them scale up their work to help bring about the downfall of the Trump-Musk-Vance regime while building the grassroots movement to build a better future for all of us? Your ongoing donation couldn\\'t be more important in these perilous times. [ ]Yes, I\\'ll chip in $5 a month. If you\\'ve saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately. [ ]No, I\\'m sorry, I can\\'t make a monthly donation. Make no mistake: Trump, Vance, and Musk continue to be an indiscriminate wrecking ball that has already caused major destruction and will continue to harm our communities and weaken and isolate America. But their takeover has been slowed. Their plan was based on doing so much, so fast that the rest of us would give in to negativity and despair. They want a dictatorship built on hopelessness and fear. That may have been the case initially, but we can take courage from the green shoots of rebellion now appearing across America and the world. Even so, the democracy movement now emerging will take years to rebuild and strengthen what has been destroyed, and to fix the raging inequalities, injustices, and corruption that led so many to vote for Trump a second time. Those of you who want the leaders of the Democratic Party to step up and be heard are right, of course. But political parties do not lead. The antiwar movement and the Civil Rights Movement didn\\'t depend on the Democratic Party for their successes. They depended on a mass mobilization of all of us who accepted the responsibilities of being American. More than 55 years ago, I participated in the resistance to the Vietnam War—a resistance that ultimately ended the war and caused a once-powerful president to resign. That resistance gave us courage we didn\\'t even know we had. Today, we will prevail because we are relearning the basic truth—that we are the leaders we\\'ve been waiting for. Join me, and help support MoveOn\\'s capacity to train, organize, and communicate with millions of us all across the country to stop the Trump-Musk-Vance regime and build a burgeoning America that serves all of us. Donate$5 a month. [ ]Yes, I\\'ll chip in $5 a month. If you\\'ve saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately. [ ]No, I\\'m sorry, I can\\'t make a monthly donation. It will be a very long and hard road forward. But we\\'re on it together. Thanks for all you do. –Robert Reich Source: 1. \"\\'Long Live the King\\': Trump Likens Himself to Royalty on Truth Social,\" The New York Times, February 23, 2025 Want to support MoveOn\\'s work? Donald Trump and his MAGA allies expect us to give up. But we will not give them what they want. We will never stop working to defend our fundamental freedoms and protect our democracy. MoveOn has been leading the movement against right-wing extremism for 26 years, and we promise you that we will still be here every step of the way forward. Will you start a monthly donation to sustain MoveOn\\'s work to protect our freedoms and democracy under Trump\\'s administration? [ ]Yes, I\\'ll chip in $5 a month.

And we’re never done discovering parts of ourselves that are ready to bloom.Yes, aging comes with challenges.But those challenges can be portals into deeper meaning, stronger relationships, and new forms of creativity.The field of positive aging reveals that mindset, lifestyle, and social connection profoundly shape our later-life experience. The key takeaway? We have far more influence over the aging process than many of us realize.Our newest tool pack,[17 Positive Aging Exercises]( will help you to put these insights into practice with those you help.[Image of 17 Positive Aging Exercises]( more →]( created this collection for practitioners, coaches, and therapists who want to help clients see their later years as an invitation to:✔ Reclaim purpose and discover deeper meaning✔ Cultivate resilience and self-compassion during transitions✔ Stay socially connected and rooted in the relationships that matter✔ Move forward with more curiosity, less fearImportantly, the exercises in this pack aren't just for helping people in later life... you’ll find they adapt beautifully to any client facing a new chapter or seeking deeper meaning.If this sounds like something that could help your work, you can [learn more about the tools inside the pack here]( celebrate the launch of this new collection, you can get it this week for the special price of just $1 per tool.[Yes, I'd like to offer my clients a new story of aging →]( AllenCEOPositivePsychology.com©PositivePsychology.comSent to: alexanderbarriga03@gmail.com | PositivePsychology.com Basisweg 10 Amsterdam, 1043 AP | Don't want future emails?

       "  'body': \" Options trading requires a well-structured systematic approach. EPATCurriculum Hi Alexander, It's very common for traders to feel overwhelmed due to the unpredictability of the options market. Many traders follow their gut, but the options trading requires a systematic process. In this classroom, we will discuss a systematic way to approach options trading.Want to learn options trading from scratch and master advanced concepts like volatility trading? Check out the EPAT curriculum! It covers everything from Python for trading, Options Trading & Strategies, market microstructure, portfolio optimization, backtesting and many more.

The presented strategy results are intended solely for educational purposes and should not be interpreted as investment advice. This classroom is structured as follows: Systematic Options Trading Process Step 1: Retrieve, Clean and Store the Data Step 2: Filter Options Step 3: Define Entry and Exit Rules Step 4: Evaluate the Performance Step 5: Optimisation Step 6: Forward Testing Complexity level: Intermediate Author: Varun Kumar Pothula Systematic Options Trading Process The systematic options trading process is a methodical approach to trading options, based on a well-defined set of rules. This process relies on data analysis, quantitative models, and automated systems to execute trades, aiming to minimise human emotions and biases. The systematic options trading process involves 6 steps. Step 1: Retrieve, Clean and Store the Data The first step in the systematic trading process is to retrieve, store, and clean the data. This data can come from paid vendors or free sources like Yahoo Finance and Google Finance. For options trading, you need data on the underlying asset (Open, High, Low, Close) and its options (type, historical price, volume, open interest, strike price, expiry). Additionally, derived data such as implied volatility and options Greeks are helpful. For event-based or long-term strategies, fundamental data like corporate events and quarterly reports are necessary. Figure: Types of data to be collected for options trading For example, for the underlying asset like the S&P 500 index, the information on macroeconomic reports can be considered fundamental data while the options contracts data of SPX, and XSP can be considered as options data. Once the data is retrieved, we should perform data quality checks such as checking for missing values, outliers and robustness. It should be noted that the better the quality of the data, the better the systematic trading process. Once the data is cleaned, the options data, underlying asset data and derived data can be in separate pickle files. For example, storing the data as a pickle file with the .bz2 extension not only saves disk space by compressing the data, it also preserves the exact data types and structures. Alternatively, the data can be stored in databases such as the ORACLE database or Microsoft Access. However, even for a single asset, it is a herculean task to collect, clean and store the above data for all the options contracts for each strike price. Hence, you need to create a screener to filter out the irrelevant data. Step 2: Filter Options For every asset, there are many options contracts based on the type of option, expiry and strike price. For effective systematic trading, you should create screening criteria to select the relevant options data. This would help to select the relevant options data instead of analysing hundreds of options contracts per day. For example, the S&P 500 index has options contracts that expire daily, weekly, and monthly. If you wish to trade only weekly expiry options, the first step of filtering is to select the weekly options contract. Next, you can filter out the illiquid options contracts related to the strike prices with either bid or ask as 0. Once the liquid options contracts of relevant expiry are selected, they can be further filtered by selecting the options contract with high open interest. Step 3: Define Entry and Exit Rules The options strategy is selected based on the market view and risk management. A view of the market can be formed based on the direction and volatility. For example, based on the expected market direction, a bullish, bearish or sideways view can be developed. Similarly, based on your analysis of market volatility, a volatility view can be developed. The following are the example options strategies based on the market view. Figure: Example options strategies based on market view Every strategy has a payoff that gives information about the maximum profit and loss of the strategy. Depending on the options strategy selected and its payoff, define the entry and exit rules of the strategy. You can learn the fundamental concepts and implementation of options strategies through live lectures in EPAT. EXPLORE NOW EPAT Early Bird offer ends on 8th March! Enroll now for the discounted fees! Step 4: Evaluate the Performance Once a strategy is selected and its exit and entry conditions are defined, evaluate its performance in the historical time period. This can be done by backtesting where the trades are taken based on entry and exit conditions in the past. For example, for a short butterfly spread strategy, the entry and exit conditions can be based on implied volatility rank (IVP) and ADX indicator to confirm the volatility and trend characteristics. The exit conditions can also include risk management measures such as stop-loss and take-profit. Based on the performance of the strategy in the past, we can extract insights such as average profit, and maximum loss that can be expected from this strategy using the performance metrics Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, annualised volatility, compound annual growth rate (CAGR), profit and loss analysis. For example, here is the performance of a short butterfly spread strategy of the NIFTY50 index from Jan 2019 to April 2022. Step 5: Optimisation The strategy performance can be improved by optimisation. This is done by tweaking the parameters of the strategy either to maximise the profit or minimise the risk or both. For example, you can tweak the parameters such as stop-loss and take-profit of the strategy in the backtest to optimise. However, it should be noted that optimising multiple parameters of the strategy often leads to overfitting to the backtest period. This overfitting results in a strategy that performs well on historical data but fails to generalise to new, unseen data, thereby reducing the reliability and efficiency of the backtest. Step 6: Forward Testing It should be noted that the strategy was only backtested based on past data. Even though the strategy is profitable on historical data, it doesn’t make it reliable and can’t always guarantee similar future returns. Hence, you should also test the strategy on the current market scenario. This process is termed as forward testing or paper trading. Once the results in forward testing are satisfactory, you can deploy the same strategy in live markets.

Last week, they emailed Elon Musk their requisite approx. five \"bullets ( listing their accomplishments for the week. He will apparently feed the responses to an LLM ( creating an automated portrait of what the government has accomplished.Takes exploded after Musk sent that email on Saturday. An engineering lead in the U.S. Digital Service used it to prompt a long letter to both Musk and Susie Wiles ( the White House Chief of Staff, explaining how indiscriminate firings have left him without a team to carry out the work of making government more efficient. Others explained that the email was no way to lead a team ( (or even to measure productivity). Mainly, workers found it insulting because Musk is not their boss and does not work within their agency ( Others, like my friend, just responded normally.One perspective, on Medium, felt different. Canadian writer Jennifer Robson ( notes that a group of current or former Shopify execs tweeted a \"glowing endorsement\" of DOGE\\'s strategy, comparing it to the Canadian government\\'s \"Program Review\" strategy in the \\'90s ( Robson worked in the Canadian government between 1994–1995 and 2007–2010, so she has some insider knowledge here.Essentially, Program Review created a new process for teams to shed resources they no longer needed. \"This could include doing less but better with fewer resources,\" she explains. Every investment needed to pass a number of tests:Source: Bourgon, J. (2009) \"Program Review: The Government of Canada\\'s experience eliminating the deficit, 1994–99: A Canadian case study\", The Institute for Government, United Kingdom.Robson draws a clear distinction between Program Review and DOGE. One sets up a sustainable process for keeping government accountable and maintaining efficiency; the other is sudden, chaotic, and unsustainable. Robson writes that Program Review succeeded in balancing the federal budget within three years ( because it \"followed the rules of our system and institutions. It didn\\'t look to break them. It was aimed at making them stronger.\" And, fundamentally, it empowered people who understand the system best\\u200a-\\u200anot interlopers or newcomers\\u200a-\\u200ato ask: \"Do we still need this?\"- Harris Sockel🌊 Also today: life on a submarineJon Davison ( takes us aboard the HMAS Rankin ( a submarine that can dive upwards of 590 feet. He was a guest of the Royal Australian Navy, and was invited to interview the crew and take a few photos for a coffee table book about Australian subs. He spent a total of 126 days at sea between Korea, Japan, Hawaii, and Sydney.The crew cooked \"180 extra large \\'slab pizzas\\'\" while submerged, one pretty much every Saturday night they were at sea, he writes. For Davison, the trip was memorable because it forced strangers to cooperate in ways they never would have to on land (or even at sea level). \"You MUST have trust and honour, you MUST be well organized, you MUST have humility and respect, you MUST be able to let go, to get on with each other and grow personally.\"Image Credit: Jon Ward Davison👽 A dash of practical wisdomNot doing what matters most to you?

And as Ethan Mollick shared, these figures likely undercount actual usage, as increasingly sophisticated outputs can evade detection (and many detectors [straight up don’t work]( numbers are just the tip of the iceberg. As commenter put it, “LinkedIn is ruined” with AI-generated corporate speak too, and many middle management memos probably are as well. Soon, we might need to archive “natural English” like it’s an endangered species. _Isn’t 2025 fun?!_**Here’s what you need to know about AI today:*** Sesame demonstrated a freaky new voice AI. * Anthropic raised $3.5B while Murati's startup eyed $1B.* Perplexity, Deutsche Telekom plan a sub-$1K AI phone for 2026* AI chipmaker TSMC to spend $100B+ on US AI chip facilities.Advertise in The Neuron here. ( image: ( # Sesame's new AI voice tech finally sounds like a real person talking to youView image: ( image link: ( There’s a new voice AI that’s [freaking out the internet]( Imagine a voice assistant that doesn't just respond to your questions but actually sounds like a human—pausing thoughtfully, expressing excitement, or offering warm reassurance.That's what [Sesame]( (created by Oculus co-founder Brendan Iribe) is building with its new AI voice technology. The model, called the Conversational Speech Model (CSM), is available to [try here via a demo]( of voice models _Maya_ and _Miles—_who just might be the most human-sounding AI voice we've _ever_ heard. **This isn’t your basic text-to-speech model. **What makes Sesame's approach different is their focus on what the company calls “voice presence”—making spoken interactions feel genuinely real and understood.According to Sesame's technical team, their breakthrough comes from treating speech generation as a contextual problem rather than just a text-to-audio conversion.**Basically, the model understands:*** The emotional context of the conversation.* Natural timing, pauses, and emphasis.* When to adjust tone to match the situation.* How to maintain a consistent personality.The Verge's Sean Hollister [described it as]( “the first voice assistant I've ever wanted to talk to more than once,” noting how it handles natural conversation in ways that leave other voice assistants feeling robotic by comparison.**Here’s a few of the wildest examples:**1. Check out this [convo]( that’s genuinely hard to tell who is AI and who is human.2. Or Miles [offering advice]( to take a break from emails on the weekend.3. Or Maya [becoming a D&D character]( on the fly. 4. Or someone [already falling for Maya]( like Joaquin Phoenix[ in the movie Her]( model also performed impressively ****in benchmark tests:*** Near-human accuracy on traditional speech metrics.* 90%+ accuracy on correctly pronouncing words like “lead” (as in metal) vs. “to guide.”* Strong performance on consistent pronunciation (saying words like “route” the same way across a full conversation).**The most impressive stat:** in blind listening tests without context, human evaluators often couldn't tell the difference between Sesame and actual human recordings.**What’s next: **Sesame is [planning to open-source]( key components of their research under an Apache 2.0 license, making it available for developers to build upon. The roadmap includes:* Scaling to larger models.* Adding support for 20+ languages.* Integrating with pre-trained language models.* Building models that can naturally manage conversation dynamics.**Our take:** Voice interfaces like ChatGPT’s [Advanced Voice Mode]( or Google [Gemini’s Voice Assistant]( still feel a bit too robotic and awkward—they're useful, but not natural enough to become our primary way of interacting with technology (_we still prefer the control of typing—for now). _Sesame (or more models like it) could change that, bringing us one step closer to talking to our devices just like we talk to each other.

We tell Attention_exactly_ what to pay attention to in our meeting (goals, budget, etc).2. Attention listens in to our call.3. After, Attention outputs important insights, action items, and follow-up emails.There’s plenty more features, too.

Start with the simplest solution possible for your task (don't overcomplicate).2. [Learn prompt engineering]( fundamentals before attempting to build agents.3. Set up your trigger point (e.g., Telegram message).4. Create a system prompt that clearly explains the agent's purpose and available tools.5. Define available tools (e.g., Google Calendar read/write permissions).6. Configure your tools with proper parameters.7. Add memory if needed to retain context.8. Test frequently throughout the building process.9. Refine your prompts iteratively based on your test results.10.

       "  'body': ' [ ]Elon and Trump want to defund public media. Add your name to protect NPR and PBS against these attacks! Dear MoveOn member, Republicans are attacking PBS and NPR from multiple directions, doing anything they can to advance their right-wing agenda to defund public broadcasting. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s so-called \"DOGE subcommittee\" has officially called for the CEOs of PBS and NPR to testify before Congress and defend their sponsorships on local stations.^1 And legislation has been introduced in the House and Senate to strip federal funding for NPR and PBS.^2 Yes, you read that right: MAGA Republicans are trying to attack these noncommercial stations for both accepting corporate underwriting and for receiving funding from the government. Their illogical, inconsistent attacks are part and parcel of their chaos agenda to eliminate essential services in favor of more tax cuts for billionaires. This is part of a decades-old Republican playbook to attack independent media, undermine it, and attempt to defund it. Project 2025 even states “the government should not be compelling the conservative half of the country to pay for the suppression of its own views.”^3 But this is just propaganda to justify their cuts. We know that everyone benefits from public media programming. And our most vulnerable communities will suffer the most from defunding public broadcasting. In many rural areas in our country, public broadcasting is the main or sole source for receiving news, emergency updates, and more. [ ]Sign the petition now to demand that Congress protect public broadcasting and not cut funding to PBS and NPR! Trump has spent the last month attacking news organizations and even recently removed the Associated Press from attending press conferences in the White House because the news outlet wouldn\\'t refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the \"Gulf of America.\"^4 It\\'s clear that Trump will go to any length to stop independent journalism that won\\'t parrot his lies. It\\'s terrifying to imagine the consequences if Trump is successful in shutting down independent media, with our news sources devolving solely into right-wing propaganda. With stakes this high, we have to act now to block Trump\\'s crusade against the freedom of press. NPR and PBS are beloved institutions that millions of people rely on all across the country—from large cities to rural areas. They provide people with access to independent journalism, educational programming, and local news. Losing these crucial news organizations would devastate many communities, but we can fight back. [ ]More than 80,000 MoveOn members are calling on Congress to protect NPR and PBS! We have to keep the momentum going. Will you sign the petition to show that you support NPR and PBS? Every person deserves access to public broadcasting! Tell Congress: Don’t cut funding to NPR and PBS! [4]Sign the petition When Hurricane Helene hit North Carolina and caused hundreds of thousands of people to lose power and access to cell service, local NPR stations became the most reliable source of news. They provided crucial information about evacuation updates and emergency information.^5 Climate disasters are hitting our communities more frequently and more intensely. Many of our communities don\\'t have the infrastructure needed to protect us during times of climate emergencies—which is why it’s even more important for every person to have access to public broadcasting. Losing access to these crucial updates during a climate emergency can leave entire communities vulnerable to more loss and destruction. The attacks on NPR and PBS are just another attempt from Republicans to strip away the services Americans need and deserve—from Medicaid to national parks to public broadcasting and so much more. We have to come together to put pressure on Republicans to stop these attacks and protect public broadcasting. [ ]Sign the petition now to demand that Congress protect NPR and PBS!

       "  'body': \"Fully Remote Principal Data Engineer Position at AI Global Research InstitutionFully Remote Principal Data Engineer Position at AI Global Research Institution Elle Jakoby Reply Alexander,I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out because I am partnering with one of the most exciting AI Research institutions, OurResearch, as they kick off a search for a Principal Data Engineer. In the simplest sense, OurResearch makes tools that make research more open. Their open-source tools are used by millions every day in universities, businesses, and libraries worldwide to uncover, connect, and analyze research projects. They are heavily invested in building OpenAlex: a nonprofit building the modern Library of Alexandria: an open knowledge graph of all scholarly papers, authors, institutions, and more. Their goal is to make this global research system—one of humankind's most beautiful creations—available to everyone, everywhere.This role will be in the driver's seat of building out the backend of OpenAlex, and implementing the entire strategy of taking this project and company to the next level of success. Right now, they are serving 10M+ API calls daily and growing fast. Users include governments (France, Netherlands, etc.), biotech (Bayer, Astro-Zeneca), software (Grammerly), universities (Sorbonne) and many more. They have recently received a 5 year grant that provides them freedom to build something amazing that positively impacts global society.This is a great opportunity to join a company that is experiencing rapid growth, operates fully remote, and employs a group of passionate people. This person will have a lot of autonomy to select systems, build out processes, and have the best talent support them.

Predicting RNA's 3D structure works the same way—using only its sequence to figure out how it folds into the structures that define its function.In this competition, you'll develop machine learning models to predict an RNA molecule's 3D structure from its sequence. With limited data available, the challenge is to fine-tune models that can accurately capture RNA's complex folding patterns.Total Prizes:$75,000Entry Deadline:May 22, 2025Learn MoreYour work could help push RNA-based medicine forward, improving treatments for cancer and genetic diseases, and help biologists understand the origin and future of life.Good luck,Walter ReadeKaggle Data ScientistKaggle, Inc 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy Mountain View, CA 94043This email was sent to alexanderbarriga03@gmail.com because you indicated that you'd like to receive news and updates about Kaggle.

       "  'body': ' Dear MoveOn member, This is Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut—a longtime friend of MoveOn and fellow MoveOn member. I am skipping President Trump\\'s speech to Congress tomorrow night—and with my friends at MoveOn, I have a better Tuesday in mind. Would you join me Tuesday evening at [ ]MoveOn.org/TrumpBS as we cut through Trump\\'s lies and bullshit with a special event during his address to Congress? [ ]RSVP now to join me, fellow lawmakers, advocates, commentators, and comedians for a virtual event as we offer a prebuttal to Trump\\'s speech and live commentary during his hour of bullshit. Look, I get it: You may just decide to skip the speech entirely. Honestly, for our collective mental health, we\\'d be better off watching reruns of \"30 Rock.\" But for the many of us who can\\'t help but tune in, we wanted to provide an alternative. Instead of listening to Trump ramble through his lies, fearmongering, and gloating, we\\'ll offer our own commentary in real time: a mix of fact-checking and, most importantly, opportunities to take action against Trump and Elon\\'s billionaire takeover ... and, yes, some good old-fashioned snark. For the 30 minutes before the speech, we\\'ll have a live conversation with lawmakers, advocates, commentators, and comedians—to lift up our spirits, lift up the stakes of what\\'s happening in this country, and lift up compelling ways all of us can mobilize and organize the opposition. Then during the speech itself, we\\'ll kick off a real-time, rapid-response chatroom. You\\'ll still be able to hear his speech (sorry) while reading our reactions and rebuttals along the way. With 10 or 20 of us commenting together, it should be robust and entertaining, giving you a dynamic way to cut through his bullshit, give opportunities to take action, and maybe even a reason to smile. So RSVP to join a growing list of special guests, including Senators Brian Schatz, and Ed Markey, Governor Matt Meyer, Michigan Lt. Governor Garlin Gilchrist II, Akilah Hughes, Wajahat Ali, Jay Willis, Lauren Bishop, Michael Ian Black, @GoldenGateBlond ... and more! [ ]RSVP now, and we\\'ll see you Tuesday evening at MoveOn.org/TrumpBS. A presidential address to Congress is usually something you don’t want to miss. But as Trump and Musk steal from us to enrich themselves and as the Republicans in both houses of Congress go along with it, I can\\'t sit there and pretend this is business as usual. There are many, many ways we need to work together, support each other, advocate, and fight in the months ahead. That\\'s exactly what we\\'re going to plan together on Tuesday. And along the way, we need the community and camaraderie of one another. [ ]Join us on Tuesday at MoveOn.org/TrumpBS—and in the work ahead. Every best wish, – Chris Murphy Want to support MoveOn\\'s work? Donald Trump and his MAGA allies expect us to give up. But we will not give them what they want. We will never stop working to defend our fundamental freedoms and protect our democracy. MoveOn has been leading the movement against right-wing extremism for 26 years, and we promise you that we will still be here every step of the way forward. Will you start a monthly donation to sustain MoveOn\\'s work to protect our freedoms and democracy under Trump\\'s administration? [ ]Yes, I\\'ll chip in $5 a month. [ ]No, I\\'m sorry, I can\\'t make a monthly donation. You can unsubscribe from this mailing list at any time:',\n",

Timescale [ ] has built a Postgres database that is revolutionizing AI application development by seamlessly integrating vector search capabilities into traditional relational databases. Thomas and Avthar discuss how their innovative approach enables developers to build powerful RAG systems and AI agents without the complexity of managing separate vector databases.Thomas (GenAI Collective): “Welcome, Collective Nation, to another installment of the GenAI Collective podcast, Collective Intelligence. We have an AI lead at Timescale with us. Do you mind explaining what Timescale is and your role there?”Avthar (Timescale): “Fantastic, Thomas, thanks so much for having me. My name is Avthar. I lead AI products at Timescale. We're a Postgres database company that’s been around for nearly 10 years, helping developers build applications over and above general relational database use cases. We focus on time series and real-time analytics, and my product group is all about AI and vector data. We build products enabling developers to create AI systems like RAG, semantic search, and even AI agents using Postgres as the core database.“Our core products include PG AI, which complements the open-source extension PGVector. All our work is open source. I’m really excited to chat about how we’re helping developers build AI applications.”Thomas: “What does your role look like day to day?”Avthar: “I’m the product lead, or PM, focusing on how to build AI applications that give reliable, accurate answers. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is often the solution. We also look at structured data retrieval, not just unstructured text or PDFs. Our job is to enable developers to build useful applications with minimal headache, using the tools they already know—extending Postgres for AI applications. I spend a lot of time talking to developers, listening to their problems, and working with our world-class engineers to help them build the next generation of AI solutions.”Thomas: “Let’s walk through the problems people face when moving from relational databases to non-relational databases—and why they come to Timescale.”Avthar: “When ChatGPT arrived, everyone realized, ‘I want ChatGPT’s power, but trained on my business or private data.’ That need brought about vector databases, which allow you to search unstructured data—texts, PDFs—by creating vector representations. It’s how you get the classic ‘chat with these documents’ use case, where you search a knowledge base for the most relevant pieces of text, feed them into the model’s context, and get targeted answers.“The question became: do you need a separate vector database? That means more infrastructure, a new query language, syncing data across two systems. A lot of developers asked, ‘Is there a way to get vector search without adding a separate database?’ PGVector effectively adds vector functionality onto Postgres. Timescale’s PGVector Scale extension boosts performance, and PG AI automates embedding creation. Our philosophy is: use the Postgres you already know and love, eliminate extra complexity, and build robust AI applications.“PGVector provides the core storage and search for vectors, while our additions make it easier to handle real-world demands like 50 million or even a billion embeddings. We also handle advanced filters—multi-tenant data, time-based constraints. All these pieces are crucial to building AI apps that give accurate answers. We solve these problems so developers can move faster, with less friction.”Thomas: “There’s a spectrum of solutions. What’s the sweet spot customer persona for Timescale?”Avthar: “You can’t build for everyone. Our typical customer has large-scale RAG or agent applications. For instance, the financial industry: analyzing massive amounts of research, PDFs, and real-time data. One of our customers, Market Reader, offers real-time market insights. They track news, integrate that with stock data, and deliver summaries to users—all backed by Postgres and Timescale.“We also excel at multi-tenant or more complex scenarios that need filtering and joins on business data. If you’re building a user-facing SaaS, you likely have different permission tiers and want to apply time-based or user-based filters. Handling it inside a single database, with simple SQL joins, is far simpler than syncing multiple systems.“A lot of specialized vector solutions evolved from narrower tasks, like Facebook AI Similarity Search (Faiss), which is purely about high-performance vector retrieval. But real-world RAG apps often demand joins, permissions, user data, and more. Postgres is naturally strong at that, and we add vector and AI functionality on top.”Thomas: “How do you handle complexity, embedding updates, and developer onboarding?”Avthar: “Our Vectorizer feature addresses the complexity of embedding pipelines. Typically, you’d have to manually embed new or updated documents and synchronize them in your vector database. We treat it more like a database index: add or delete documents, and the index updates automatically.“This also makes it easy to experiment with different embedding models. Developers can run quick tests to see if open-source embeddings perform better than, say, OpenAI embeddings. Everything is transparent, but we provide smart defaults. Experienced developers appreciate having the ability to fine-tune and see under the hood, rather than being locked into a black box.”Thomas: “What are the killer use cases people can dive into right away?”Avthar: “AI is so universally applicable that we see new use cases daily. A big one is internal co-pilots, especially for industries like energy and IoT, where technicians need fast access to detailed information about machines or updates. Another emerging area involves structured data queries—going beyond unstructured text search to marry it with relational data.“We see more advanced RAG applications combining PDFs with business data. For instance, e-commerce or finance apps that want product or account information plus relevant documents. As models improve—cost per token drops and reasoning power increases—these applications will multiply. We’re seeing innovative expansions beyond ‘chat with 10 PDFs’ toward real enterprise-level intelligence.”Thomas: “Last question: how do you see the balance between letting the model handle all reasoning vs. offloading some to the database?”Avthar: “I think advanced models—like GPT-4, Claude, or DeepSeek—will leverage tools that revolve around a robust database. Even if you have a huge context window, you still need to filter and provide high-quality context. There’s a famous ‘needle in the haystack’ issue where large context windows can confuse models. So the database’s job is less about storing the intelligence itself and more about surfacing the right context—unstructured or structured data—so the LLM can deliver accurate, useful answers.“Databases, especially Postgres, have been around a long time. They’re ‘Lindy,’ as Nassim Taleb would say, meaning something that’s stood the test of time tends to remain valuable. Combining stable ‘old’ tech like Postgres with cutting-edge AI models and agent architectures is a powerful way to build. We provide that foundation so developers can focus on delivering the best AI experiences.”Try Timescale’s new PgAI—a PostgreSQL extension for building RAG, semantic search, and AI apps directly in your database.

       "  'body': 'Hi Alexander Barriga,Discover the cutting-edge world of Partial Derivatives andJacobian Matrix in Stochastic Gradient Descent ( ), and see how it can revolutionize your projects!Image ( )🔍 IntroductionMachine learning models don’t just wake up one day knowing how tomake perfect predictions. They learn — step by step, adjustmentby adjustment — thanks to optimization techniques rooted invector calculus. Our latest tutorial dives into partialderivatives and the Jacobian matrix, breaking down how thesemathematical tools supercharge Stochastic Gradient Descent(SGD) and make model training more efficient.🖼 The Big PictureImagine you\\'re navigating a pitch-black room filled with LEGOs onthe floor (ouch!). Your goal is to find the exit, but instead ofseeing where to go, you can only tell whether your last step madethings better or worse based on foot pain intensity.This is what machine learning models do with SGD. Instead ofpain, they minimize an error function, and instead of feet, theyuse derivatives to determine the best step to take.Partial derivatives help the model figure out which direction (orvariable) causes the most \"pain\" (error). In contrast,the Jacobian matrix helps when things get really complicated —like when the room has multiple exits and obstacles.🛠 How It WorksSGD updates model parameters iteratively using gradients (whichare just collections of partial derivatives). The Jacobian matrixgeneralizes this idea to vector-valued functions — perfect forcomplex networks where multiple outputs depend on multipleinputs.In practical terms, this means:✅ Faster Convergence: The model learns efficiently withoutwasting steps.✅ Better Performance: Helps navigate the loss function landscapesmartly.✅ Scalability: Essential for deep learning and high-dimensionaloptimizations.🤔 Our ThoughtsIf you\\'ve ever struggled with the math behind machine learningoptimizations, this tutorial is for you. We break downderivatives and gradients without overwhelming you, offeringclear explanations and real-world implementations.❓ Yes, But…\"I just use libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch — why should Icare?\"Great question! Even with high-level libraries,understanding what’s happening under the hood helps you debugmodels, fine-tune hyperparameters, and build customarchitectures. Think of it like driving a race car — you don’tneed to build the engine, but knowing how it works makes you abetter driver.🧠 Stay SmartThis is Part 1 of our Vector Calculus for MachineLearning series.

I still remember where I was when I first read it. I was in the middle of Medium\\'s office at the time, at my standing desk, with my cup of very hot coffee from the bodega around the corner. It was like… 8:30 a.m.? It was a Monday, if I recall correctly. I think I was the second one in the office that day. It was dead silent and I had a ton of work to do, and I was vaguely stressed about that. Then, I opened up Medium, came across this story, and started reading.Five minutes later I was crying. A lot. (People came in with their coffees and were like… What is going on?)Since then, over 1 million people have read it. 412 people have commented. This response ( from reader Peter Boyd ( sums up why I had such a strong reaction: Somehow, Harrington\\'s essay is about grief but manages to be uplifting, nuanced, and actually helpful.I\\'m not sharing this because I want you to have to start your week bawling at your desk (even Boyd said reading it \"blew his whole work plan out of the water\"). I\\'m sharing it because it\\'s the most generous essay I\\'ve ever read.I think it\\'s rare to go through something as hard as losing your eight-year-old son to cancer, process that, and turn it into something that, in the words of one reader ( \"should be read and distributed to every children\\'s cancer center in the country.\" The most generous part is the third magical phrase, which I won\\'t quote here because pulling it out of context doesn\\'t quite work, but you\\'ll see when you read it. Maybe save it until after work.-Harris Sockel🫶 Also today…Please enjoy these brooding and beautiful original black-and-white photos of the American Southwest ( courtesy of Cynthia A Whelan ( in Live View ( middle- and high-school English teacher observes the slow decline of writing in her classroom and wonders if it will go out of fashion the way cursive did ( (although she mentions some students are \"reviving\" cursive and compares it to calligraphy).

We’re not scared of messing up; we’re scaredof being judged, embarrassed, or proven our worst insecuritiesright. But the people who actually succeed at anything are theones willing to suck at it long enough to get good. In thislatest podcast episode, we break down why failure feels soterrifying, how social comparison messes with our heads, and whythe loudest critics are usually the ones who’ve never done a damnthing themselves.We also dig into the science of why boredom can spark betterideas, why our addiction to content might be making us lesscreative, and whether we should all do a digital detox before ourbrains turn into overstimulated mush. Finally, we wrap things upwith a simple but profound question: If life is just an endlessseries of trade-offs, what are the best problems to have?

Yes criticscan pull musicians up, but it can be psychologically tough.I am someone who has learned to live on the edge, part of life inthe PA world. This time last year I courageously decided afterdoing a comedy course to deliver my life so far into a one-womanshow ‘Guilty Pleasures.’ Toughest thing I’ve done.So glad I went ahead and performed. Yes I’m a sassy super fitfabulous 74-year-old. And shall keep creating forever. Buggercritics. I did myself proud and know most people would never putthemselves out there as I did.”Another reader is not quite ready to shrug off criticism, and Ihave some tips for them you might also find helpful:“Why do I care so much? Or in Mark Manson words, why do I giveall these f*cks?Mulling that question, I realized that not feeling good enough, acore value of mine, is a feeling. And so I can\\'t control it, andI can\\'t fix it by doing things on the outside, and it won\\'t getfixed by getting outside approval. It really doesn\\'t matter whoor what in the far-away past is responsible for planting thatfeeling. It\\'s inside me, and it\\'s unlikely to ever go away. Itcan\\'t be fixed, and it can\\'t be satisfied.So, then, what can I do? The quick answer is, ‘Nothing.’ The moreproductive answer is to side-step the feeling. To let it be—that‘letting go’ thing; to not give a f*ck about that feeling, stopfeeding it, and ‘do life.’And how do you stop feeding it? I have no f*cking clue, butperhaps awareness is enough to get started. I dare to imaginethat when I am not a prisoner of ‘not good enough,’ I can sharemy writing, play music loud enough that it carries outside myroom, apply for that job, visit my kids, join an onlinecommunity, and have sushi for lunch every so often.”Letting a feeling go is a useful temporary strategy, but unlessyou’re a Buddhist monk, you are unlikely to get good at lettingyour feelings go all the time in every situation. Here are acouple suggestions for managing a chronic, negative feeling thatmaybe don’t get broadcast enough.First, once you have an awareness of the feeling, develop anon-negative feeling about the feeling. In an old article ( I called these “meta-emotions”—we all have them. We feel sad(an emotion) but then we feel guilty about our sadness (ameta-emotion).Interestingly, it’s rarely the emotion that screws us up, it’salmost always the meta-emotion. We get this idea that weshouldn’t be sad and therefore, we beat ourselves up and makeourselves feel worse and then carry over all this self-judgmentinto other areas of our life.Try to develop positive meta-emotions around your feelings ofinadequacy. Accept that this just seems to be a part of you, andinstead of dreading it or wishing it wasn’t there, develop aplayful attitude around it. “Oh, there’s my inadequacy again,always showing up just when I need it.” Sometimes you can evenname it. My wife and I have a playful name for her perfectionism.We talk about it as if it’s an actual person and make jokes aboutit. It’s actually incredibly helpful, not only for awareness, butto make sure our meta-emotions about it are positive andnon-judgmental.Once you’re in this place where you can playfully accept anegative emotion, the next question is how to channel thatemotion. Feelings of inadequacy can actually be incrediblyproductive, if you consciously channel them in a healthy way.When you are aware of the feeling, ask yourself, “What can I dowith this feeling that will leave me better off?” Maybe that’ssome extra work. Maybe that’s reaching out to a friend and sayingnice things. Maybe that’s simply connecting with a partner orfamily member and letting them know how you feel.What’s wild is that once you develop those two skills—playfulacceptance of a negative emotion, and productive channeling ofit—that negative feeling stops being negative. You’re able to sitwith it in a way that no longer causes you to suffer and it leadsto productive actions in the real world. It’s almost like youbegin to recognize it for what it is: a silly joke your brainlikes to play on you. And for years you fell for it, again andagain. But now you don’t. Now you’re in on the joke.

We try to catch you up on what’s going on with AI video every now and then here at The Neuron, but since [Veo 2]( there’s been very few releases that’ve caught our eye.Well, allow us to introduce _[Wan 2.1]( _View image: ( image link: ( The criticism around AI video in general is that “[nothing actually happens.]( AI “video” can create the illusion of motion, but the motions are slapdash and devoid of realism (the exception is [video 2 video]( where AI manipulates video footage like a graphical overlay, maintaining consistent motion but lacking [object permanence]( 2.1 _kinda_ changes that. It creates realistic, complex motions that for the most part, look legit and operate under recognizable physics. Here’s [what we mean (with a cat!). ]( according to the [VBench benchmark]( it [outperforms every other video model]( except Veo 2 (which isn’t listed for comparison, but is basically the best).**Here’s what you need to know about AI today:*** There’s a debate over how good Claude 3.7 really is. * OpenAI released SORA in Europe.* Report shows AI’s impact on websites (who wins and who loses). * A Robot face convincingly mimicked human emotions.Advertise in The Neuron here. ( image: ( # Power users are blasting Claude 3.7 for coding (and some are switching back to 3.5)View image: ( image link: ( Is the latest model from Anthropic actually _worse_ at complex coding tasks? The internet can\\'t decide. A fascinating debate is brewing on Reddit, where power users who live and breathe AI coding assistants report mixed results. On one side, there’s some [serious hype]( going on. Like, [_too much_]( It’s even gotten to the [point of parody]( everyone\\'s impressed]( with Claude 3.7 though—especially the hardcore developer crowd. Some are even ditching 3.7 altogether and crawling back to 3.5 like it\\'s an ex they never should\\'ve broken up with.One developer who spends a mind-boggling “25+ hours a week with Claude” (that\\'s more time than most of us spend with our significant others!) tested 3.7 extensively before making the walk of shame back to 3.5.**Here\\'s what\\'s bugging the power users:*** **3.7 is an overdesigning machine.** One poor soul watched their tidy 400-line script explode into a 1,100-line monster. More isn\\'t always better, Claude!* **It has selective hearing**. Users report it ignores instructions more often than a teenager being asked to clean their room.* **The personality downgrade is real.** 3.7 apparently has the conversational charm of a wooden table.* **It suffers from complexity amnesia**. While it starts strong, it gets lost in the sauce on longer, more complex projects.Our favorite call out? “_3.7 feels like a senior McKinsey consultant-presenting model that\\'s mastered the art of lying to your face about how good they are at solving your problems_.” Ouch.View image: ( This about sums it up.**But not everyone\\'s having a bad time!** The 3.7 defenders are speaking up too, and they\\'ve found ways to make it work:* Ditch the back-and-forth conversation style and front-load everything in detailed initial prompts.* Be _ridiculously specific_ about constraints (basically, micromanage the AI).* Start fresh projects rather than continuing existing work.* Make your expectations crystal clear.One success story [reported that]( 3.7 \"reduced duplication of code in a project from 9% to 4% and increased code coverage from 85% to 90%\" — all for about $8 in API costs. _Not too shabby._**What\\'s going on here? **While 3.5 thrived as a collaborative coding buddy, 3.7 seems built for autonomous problem-solving with clear boundaries and comprehensive instructions.This points to a broader trend in AI development: as models get more sophisticated, they may become less suitable as collaborative partners and more valuable as autonomous problem-solvers—who need _clear boundaries_ and _comprehensive instructions_.**Our key takeaway:** AI model releases are getting to be like smartphone upgrades—newer doesn\\'t _always_ mean better for your specific needs. And sometimes, that previous model you\\'re comfortable with is still the right tool for the job.View image: ( ###### **FROM OUR PARTNERS**# AI Exposed Part 2: Separating Fact from FictionView image: ( image link: ( Are you a CxO, GM, or Department Head ready to separate AI fact from fiction?_This webinar is for you.__** **_Join [WethosAI]( CEO Stuart McClure and CTO Alen Capalik on March 13th for “[AI Exposed Part 2: The Hype Must Die!]( learn…*** Why Humans + AI > AI.* How to navigate the Generative AI landscape.* How AI facilitates crucial conversations.Plus, you’ll discover the essential “[long-thinking skills”]( for your workforce and ensure responsible implementation.Cut through the AI hype and discover the _real_ power of AI model training, reasoning, and inference.[Register for the FREE webinar now (and get the recording if you can’t attend live)]( image: ( # Prompt Tip of the DayView image: ( image link: ( Most people won’t get to use ChatGPT-4.5 for everyday use because its too expensive to run (you either need the $200 a month Pro account, or an API account that\\'ll max out a JP Morgan Sapphire card).

Southwest Airlines is responsible for the redemption of Rapid Rewards® points toward benefits and services. The number of points needed for a particular Southwest flight is set by Southwest and will vary depending on destination, time, day of travel, demand, point redemption rate, and other factors and is subject to change. Rapid Rewards points can only be transferred to the primary Cardmember’s Rapid Rewards account. All Rapid Rewards rules and regulations apply and can be found at Southwest.com/rrterms. Southwest reserves the right to amend, suspend, or change the program and/or program rules at any time without notice. Rapid Rewards Members do not acquire property rights in accrued points. Southwest Rapid Rewards® Credit Cards are issued by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Member FDIC. Accounts subject to credit approval. Restrictions and limitations apply. Companion Pass After You Spend $4,000 On Purchases In The First 3 Months From Account Opening: To qualify for Companion Pass®, you must make Purchases totaling $4,000 or more during the first 3 months from account opening. Please allow up to 8 weeks for Companion Pass to post to your Rapid Rewards® account. (“Purchases” do not include balance transfers, cash advances, travelers checks, foreign currency, money orders, wire transfers or similar cash-like transactions, lottery tickets, casino gaming chips, race track wagers or similar betting transactions, any checks that access your account, interest, unauthorized or fraudulent charges, and fees of any kind, including an annual fee, if applicable.) To be eligible for this promotional Companion Pass offer, account must be open and not in default at the time of fulfillment. Promotional Companion Pass is valid through February 28, 2026. Promotional Companion Pass entitles the Member to designate a Companion to fly free of carrier charges (does not include taxes and fees from $5.60 one way) anywhere with the Member on the same Southwest Airlines® flight that is purchased (with cash or points) by the Member. Promotional Companion Pass travel is subject to taxes, fees, and other government or airport-imposed charges from $5.60 per one-way trip. Applicable taxes, fees, and other government or airport-imposed charges can vary significantly based on your arrival and departure destination. The payment of any taxes, fees, and other government or airport-imposed charges must be paid when the reservation is made. Any additional tax liability, if imposed, is the responsibility of Companion Pass traveler. If you otherwise qualify for regular Companion Pass valid in 2025, the regular Companion Pass qualifications will supersede the promotional Companion Pass. Visit Southwest.com® to review the full Companion Pass program rules and regulations. All Rapid Rewards rules and regulations apply and can be found at Southwest.com/rrterms. Earn 30,000 Bonus Points After You Spend $4,000 On Purchases In The First 3 Months From Account Opening: The product is not available to either (i) current Cardmembers of any Southwest Rapid Rewards® Credit Card, or (ii) previous Cardmembers of any Southwest Rapid Rewards Credit Card who received a new Cardmember bonus within the last 24 months. This does not apply to Cardmembers of the Southwest Rapid Rewards Business Card and Employee Credit Card products. To qualify for your bonus points, you must make Purchases totaling $4,000 or more during the first 3 months from account opening. Please allow up to 8 weeks for bonus points to post to your Rapid Rewards® account. (“Purchases” do not include balance transfers, cash advances, travelers checks, foreign currency, money orders, wire transfers or similar cash-like transactions, lottery tickets, casino gaming chips, race track wagers or similar betting transactions, any checks that access your account, interest, unauthorized or fraudulent charges, and fees of any kind, including an annual fee, if applicable.) To be eligible for this bonus offer, account must be open and not in default at the time of fulfillment. Earning in the Rewards Program: You’ll earn points on purchases of products and services, minus returns or refunds, made with a Rapid Rewards® Credit Card by you or an authorized user of the account. Buying products and services with your card, in most cases, will count as a purchase; however, the following types of transactions won’t count as a purchase and won’t earn points: balance transfers, cash advances and other cash-like transactions, lottery tickets, casino gaming chips, race track wagers or similar betting transactions, any checks that access your account, interest, unauthorized or fraudulent charges, and fees of any kind, including an annual fee, if applicable. 2 points: You’ll earn 2 points for each $1 spent on purchases made directly with Southwest Airlines®, including flight, inflight, Southwest® gift card, and Southwest Vacations® package purchases, and at participating Rapid Rewards® hotel and rental car partners. 2 points: You’ll earn 2 points for each $1 spent on purchases in the local transit and commuting rewards category. 2 points: You’ll earn 2 points for each $1 spent on purchases in the following rewards categories: internet, cable, and phone services; select streaming services. 1 point: You’ll earn 1 point for each $1 spent on all other purchases. 1 point on balance transfers: You’ll earn 1 point for each $1 of the first $10,000 of balance transfers made during the first 90 days from your original account open date. 3,000 bonus points each account anniversary year: You’ll receive 3,000 bonus points each account anniversary year. “Account anniversary year” means the year beginning with your account open date through the anniversary of your account open date, and each 12 months after that. Information about earning/transferring points to Southwest Airlines®: Points earned during a billing cycle will be automatically transferred to Southwest Airlines after the end of each billing cycle. Losing points: You’ll immediately lose all points that haven’t been transferred to Southwest Airlines if your card account status changes, or your card account is closed for program misuse, fraudulent activities, or other reasons described in the terms of the Rewards Program Agreement. For important information about Chase rewards categories, see chase.com/RewardsCategoryFAQs. For more information about the Rapid Rewards® Plus Card rewards program, you can see the latest Rewards Program Agreement at chase.com/swapluscard/rewardsagreement and it will also be available for cardmembers after logging in to chase.com and will be mailed for new or changed accounts. Southwest® EarlyBird Check-In®: Each anniversary year you will be reimbursed for the purchase of up to 2 EarlyBird Check-In services made with your Southwest Rapid Rewards® Plus Credit Card. Each EarlyBird Check-In service means a purchase made for EarlyBird Check-In one-way, per Passenger. Anniversary year means the year beginning with your account open date through the first statement date after your account open date anniversary, and the 12 monthly billing cycles after that each year. If you switch to this product from another Chase credit card, your account open date is the date the switch to the Southwest Rapid Rewards® Plus Credit Card is completed. EarlyBird Check-In provides automatic check-in before the traditional 24-hour check-in and can be purchased as part of the original flight purchase or added to a flight after purchase. Price of EarlyBird Check-In may vary. Statement credit(s) will post to your account the same day your purchase posts to your account and will appear on your monthly credit card billing statement within 1-2 billing cycles. Account must be open and not in default at the time the statement credit is posted to your account. Statement credits will be issued for the anniversary year in which the transaction posts to your account. For example, if you purchase EarlyBird Check-In and Southwest does not post the transaction until after your current anniversary year ends, the cost of the EarlyBird Check-In services will be allocated towards the following year’s maximum of 2 services. More information can be found at Southwest.com/early-bird. Companion Pass Qualifying Points: Companion Pass® qualifying points are earned from revenue flights booked through Southwest®, points earned on Rapid Rewards® Credit Cards, and base points earned from Rapid Rewards partners. The following do not count as Companion Pass qualifying points: purchased points; points transferred between Members; points converted from hotel and car loyalty programs, e-Rewards®, Valued Opinions, and Diners Club®; points earned from Rapid Rewards program enrollment, tier bonus points; flight bonus points; and partner bonus points (with the exception of the Rapid Rewards Credit Cards from Chase). No points nor tier or Companion Pass qualifying points will be awarded for flights taken by the Companion when flying on a Companion Pass reservation. Points earned during a billing cycle on a Southwest Airlines Rapid Rewards Credit Card from Chase are not available for redemption or qualification for Companion Pass status until they are posted on your billing statement and posted to your Rapid Rewards account. Only points posted on your billing statements and posted to your Rapid Rewards account during the same calendar year are available for qualification for Companion Pass status. For example, if you make a purchase after your December billing statement cycle date, the points on those purchases will not count toward Companion Pass status in the year the purchase was made; they will appear on your January billing statement and post to your Rapid Rewards account in January. Companion Pass Qualifying Points Boost: As a Southwest Rapid Rewards Cardmember, you will earn one boost of 10,000 Companion Pass qualifying points each calendar year. The boost will be deposited into your eligible Rapid Rewards account by January 31st each calendar year or up to 30 days after account opening. To receive Companion Pass qualifying points boost your credit card account must be open and not in default at the time of fulfillment. Only one credit card account per Southwest Rapid Rewards Member (Rapid Rewards Member must be the primary Cardmember on that account), is eligible for one boost of 10,000 Companion Pass qualifying points per calendar year. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is not responsible for the provision of, or failure to provide, the stated benefits and services. No Blackout Dates and Unlimited Reward Seats: No blackout dates and unlimited reward seats apply to flights booked with points. No Change Fee: Fare difference may apply.

Psst…looking for events? Check out upcoming events on the climatemap.la 🌴👀 Read the Official LetterDear Elected Officials,As Angelenos and global citizens, we urge you to commit to rebuilding LA S.A.F.E. Our communities deserve a recovery from the Palisades and Eaton fires that is:Secure from future disasters,Affordable for all residents,Fast in restoring people’s lives, andElectric to power us safely.Los Angeles has just suffered one of its worst fire disasters. Over 10,000 homes are gone, financial losses are estimated at $150–$250 billion, and thousands of families have lost their livelihoods—some, their loved ones.Rebuilding must not only restore what was lost but also strengthen our communities for future disasters. Yet, instead of using this moment to create a safer, more resilient LA, our local, county, and state leaders are repeating past mistakes [ ]. On January 13th, Mayor Karen Bass suspended the city’s all-electric construction rule (Ordinance No. 187,714 [ ]) for the affected communities, a decision that will burden Angelenos with higher costs and increased safety risks for decades.Suspending the all-electric rule is unsafe for Angelenos. In an attempt to “cut red tape,” this decision will slow recovery and drive up long-term utility costs for both homeowners and the city. Every home rebuilt with methane gas (natural gas) is a 30-year commitment to hazardous, outdated, and expensive infrastructure.Our city is sending the wrong message by sidelining policies meant to future-proof our communities from disasters like the one we just faced. Instead, we should seize this moment to marshal state and federal resources to build a stronger LA. A fast, safe, and affordable rebuild is possible, so why throw away this opportunity?With the 2028 Olympics ahead, LA can show the world how to rebuild proactively. Healing from this tragedy means embracing clean energy, not welcoming back dirty fossil fuels into our communities that make wildfires, heat waves, and storms even more destructive. Rebuilding homes without new methane gas hookups should be a common-sense step in response to this disaster—especially for a forward-looking city like Los Angeles.Elected Officials: don’t jeopardize LA’s future. A “business as usual” rebuild is unsafe, costly, and slow. We urge you to prioritize a livable future by committing to a S.A.F.E. rebuild for Los Angeles.Sincerely,The UndersignedWant more fun local climate news, events, memes and more?

       "  'body': ' Leverage Pine Script to create custom indicators and automated backtesting for TradingView. Hi Alexander, To automate the backtesting of strategies and live trading in TradingView, you need to use Pine Script. It is a programming language specifically designed for the TradingView platform. Automated Trading with MT5 & TradingView Thursday, April 10 REGISTER FOR FREE Join this webinar to learn how to use Python & Pine Script to automate trading on platforms like MetaTrader & TradingView. Overview of Backtesting Strategy with Pine Script What is Pine Script? Pine Script is a scripting language unique to TradingView, a widely used web-based platform designed for charting and analysing financial markets. With Pine Script, users can craft personalised technical indicators and trading strategies tailored to their specific needs within the TradingView environment. Here\\'s an overview of some of the key syntax elements: Comments - Single-line comments start with //. Multi-line comments are enclosed in /* ... */. Version Declaration - You should specify the Pine Script version using//@version. Variables - Variables are defined using the var keyword. Variables must be declared before they are used. Plotting Data - You can plot data on the chart using the plot function. Conditional Statements - Pine Script supports if statements for conditional execution. This Pine Script code uses plotarrowup to display a green upward arrow labelled \"Bullish\" when the closing price is higher than the opening price, indicating a bullish condition. Similarly, it employs plotarrowdown to show a red downward arrow labelled \"Bearish\" when the closing price is lower than the opening price, signifying a bearish condition. This helps traders quickly visualise market sentiment on a price chart. Functions - Pine Script includes built-in functions for technical analysis (e.g., sma, ema, rsi, etc.). You can also create custom functions. This Pine Script code defines a custom function named myCustomFunction, which calculates the simple moving average (SMA) of a given data source (src) over a specified period (length). Then, it uses the plot function to display the SMA with a period of 14 as a blue line on the chart. Operators - Pine Script supports arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators like+, -, *, /, <, >, ==, !=, and, or, etc. Alerts - You can create alerts using the alertcondition function. Input Variables - You can create input variables to make your script more customisable. This Pine Script code allows for a customisable Simple Moving Average (SMA) study. Users can adjust the SMA period length using the \"length\" input variable, which influences the SMA calculation. The script then plots the SMA on the price chart with a blue colour. This flexibility makes it easy for traders to adapt the SMA to their preferred settings and trading strategies. This is just a basic overview of Pine Script syntax. Pine Script can become quite complex when implementing advanced strategies and indicators. TradingView\\'s Pine Script documentation is an excellent resource to learn more and explore the full capabilities of the language. Backtesting Trading Strategies with Pine Script in TradingView Now that you have a basic understanding of the syntax of Pine Script, let’s explore how to backtest a trading strategy in Pine Script. 1. Strategy Overview - Our strategy is based on a simple moving average (SMA) crossover. It involves two SMAs - a shorter one and a longer one. When the shorter SMA crosses above the longer SMA, it generates a buy signal, and when it crosses below, it generates a sell signal. 2. Pine Script Implementation - Let\\'s implement this strategy in Pine Script. We\\'ll use a 100-period SMA as the long SMA and a 50-period SMA as the short SMA. Here\\'s the code - This Pine Script code implements a Simple Moving Average (SMA) crossover strategy. It uses the input function to customise SMA lengths, calculates the fast and slow SMAs with the sma method, and plots them on the chart. The strategy\\'s long and short conditions are determined using crossover and crossunder methods based on the relationship between the fast and slow SMAs. It then enters long or short positions using the strategy.entry function when the conditions are met, overlaying the strategy on the price chart. Backtesting in TradingView Step 1 - Log in to your TradingView account and navigate to a symbol you want to test the strategy on. Step 2 - Click on “Pine Editor” at the left bottom of the screen and enter the Pine Script code. It’s a good practice to name the script. Let’s name this script as my_script. Step 3 - Click on the \"Indicators\" tab on the top bar and add the strategy you created by searching for its name. This would apply the strategy to the contract selected and you will see the short and long positions marked on the chart as per the strategy. Step 4 -Click on “Strategy Tester” at the bottom right and click on the “Settings” button to configure the strategy. Step 5 -To visit the backtest results, click on the “Overview” tab to get the overview of the backtest such as performance plot, Net Profit, Total Closed Trades, and other performance metrics. Step 6-To get a complete performance summary of the strategy backtest, click on the “Performance Summary” tab. Step 7-Click on the tab “List of Trades” to get trade-wise details of all the trades taken during the backtest. Remember that this is a basic example. Pine Script offers more advanced features for creating complex trading strategies, including risk management, multiple conditions, and custom indicators. What to do next?

       "  'body': '[YouTube]( | [SV AI Think Tank Meetup ]( [LinkedIn]( | [Your Free AI PRD]( to 8 bits for a Byte:** AI isn’t just a tool—it’s a competitive battlefield. This week, we’re tackling the biggest AI leadership questions: How do you choose the right AI model for your business? What does AI product management really look like? And are you making AI a business driver—or just an efficiency hack? We’re also diving into AI’s latest workplace takeover—meeting delegates. Ready to build an AI strategy that actually gives you an edge? **Let’s go!**Here\\'s what caught my eye in the world of AI this week:----------View image: ( Welcome, To 8 bits for a Byte# Here\\'s what caught my eye in the world of AI this week:Youtube: Open Source vs. Proprietary AI: What Every Leader Needs to Know ( **Data, AI, and Trust: What Every Leader Needs to Know About Open Source vs. Proprietary Models**If you’re integrating AI into your business, here are **five critical factors** to consider when choosing between open-source and proprietary AI models.———————————————————————————### **1. Data Security: Who Controls Your Data?**.🔹 **Open Source:** You have control over where and how the model is hosted—whether on-premises, in the cloud, or through an inference service provider. You manage data retention and security policies..🔹 **Proprietary Models:** Your data is sent to an external provider, and their data retention policies vary. Many **do not** default to zero data retention—you must request it, and approval isn’t guaranteed..🔹 **Key Takeaway:** If data security is a priority (especially in regulated industries like healthcare and finance), open-source models provide **greater control** over data handling.———————————————————————————### **2. Update Control: Who Decides When Your Model Changes?**.🔹 **Open Source:** You decide if and when to update your model. No forced upgrades.🔹 **Proprietary Models:** The vendor updates the model on their schedule. While most give notice, at some point, you will be required to adapt..🔹 **Key Takeaway:** If stability and version control are essential for your business, open-source models offer **more predictable updates**.———————————————————————————### **3. Customization: Can You Tailor the Model to Your Needs?**🔹 **Open Source:** You can modify the model, access weights, and in some cases, see the training data..🔹 **Proprietary Models:** Customization is limited to fine-tuning within the constraints of the vendor’s platform..🔹 **Key Takeaway:** If you need a highly specialized AI model, open-source solutions provide **deeper customization**.———————————————————————————### **4. Transparency: Do You Know How the Model Works?**.🔹 **Open Source:** Many models disclose training methodologies and data sources.🔹 **Proprietary Models:** The training process is a black box—you don’t know exactly what data was used..🔹 **Key Takeaway:** If **AI explainability** is a concern (for regulatory compliance or ethical AI initiatives), open-source models offer **more visibility**.———————————————————————————### **5. Quality: Does Open Source Mean Better or Worse Performance?**🔹 Proprietary models, like GPT-4, often have cutting-edge performance because they’re trained on massive datasets with advanced infrastructure..🔹 Open-source models are improving **rapidly**, with some now rivaling proprietary models in specific domains..🔹 **Key Takeaway:** If you need state-of-the-art general performance, proprietary models might still have an edge—but open-source models are closing the gap **fast**.———————————————————————————### **The Bottom Line: Choose What Aligns with Your AI Strategy**When adopting AI, it’s not about **which model is best**—it’s about **which model best aligns with your business needs**.✅ If you prioritize **control, security, and customization**, open-source models give you more flexibility..✅ If you value **ease of use, pre-trained intelligence, and enterprise support**, proprietary models might be a better fit.View image: ( # Quote of the weekView image: ( 2. This quote really made me pause and reflect. It reminded me of the corporate practice of repeating key takeaways at least five times—so they either sink in or your team starts saying, _“No más!”_.But there’s a fine line between ensuring clarity and over-explaining to the point of exhaustion. I’ve seen both sides—my dad was a classic over-explainer, and I’ll admit, I can fall into that trap too. Finding the balance between reinforcing a message and overwhelming people is something I’m always working on.View image: ( View image: ( image link: ( 3. [Introduction to AI Product Management: Neural Networks, Transformers, and LLMs]( is a great breakdown of AI fundamentals for Product Managers! To make it even more digestible, below an **AI Quick Bytes** version with key takeaways.There is Paywall for the above article but there is a seven day free trial and you can read most of it for free. If you are a Product Manager / Program Manager or interested in becoming the Product Compass by [Pawel Huryn]( is a must subscribe.———————————————————————————### **AI for Product Managers: A Crash Course**🚀 **AI is transforming product management**, and every PM should understand the basics. Let\\'s break it down:#### **1. The AI Landscape & Key Terms*** **Generative AI** creates new content, not just analyzes data.* **Types of Machine Learning:** * **Supervised:** Learns from labeled data (e.g., fine-tuning models).* **Unsupervised:** Finds patterns in unlabeled data.* **Reinforcement:** Learns via rewards (e.g., AlphaGo).* **Deep Learning:** Uses multi-layered neural networks.* **LLMs (Large Language Models):** Pre-trained AI models for text tasks.🛠 **Action:** Identify AI-powered tools relevant to your product and experiment with them.#### **2. How Neural Networks Work*** Inspired by the human brain, neural networks process data in layers.* Training involves **weights, activation functions, and backpropagation** to optimize accuracy.* Great for classification but struggles with sequential data (e.g., language).🛠 **Action:** Try the [TensorFlow Playground]( to visualize neural networks in action.#### **3. How Transformers and LLMs Work*** Transformers introduced **self-attention**, allowing models to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence.* **Key Steps in Text Processing:** * **Tokenization**: Break text into smaller pieces.* **Positional Encoding**: Helps track word order.* **Encoding & Decoding**: Processes input and generates responses.* LLMs use vast datasets + deep learning to generate human-like text.🛠 **Action:** Test GPT-powered applications (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) to understand their strengths and weaknesses.#### **4. Transformers vs. The Human Brain**🤖 **AI Models:** Fixed after training, rely on vast data, struggle with generalization.🧠 **Human Brain:** Constantly adapts, learns from few examples, retains memory over time.⚡ **AI is not replacing human thinking—it’s a tool to enhance it.**🛠 **Action:** Learn to leverage AI as a **co-pilot** rather than fearing it as a competitor.View image: ( **4. **[Beyond AI Commoditization: Building Competitive Advantage]( **AI is now a commodity. What’s next?**With OpenAI’s GPT, Microsoft’s Big AI, and Google’s Gemini widely available, AI is no longer a competitive differentiator by itself. **Business leaders must think beyond efficiency and cost savings to stay ahead.**#### **1. AI Alone Won’t Set You Apart*** Just like IT before it, AI is following the path of commoditization—ubiquitous but less strategically valuable.* Companies that succeed will integrate AI into their core operations and customer offerings rather than just using off-the-shelf models.* Competitive advantage lies in proprietary knowledge, not the AI model itself.🛠 **Action:** Identify **unique data, processes, and expertise** that can fuel your AI models.#### **2. AI as a Catalyst for Business Transformation*** AI isn’t just an efficiency tool—it can reshape markets and enable new business models.* Startups leveraging AI strategically (e.g., Runway in art & entertainment) are gaining rapid market traction.* AI-driven insights can empower businesses to adapt faster and make better decisions.🛠 **Action:** Rethink your **business model, market approach, and product offerings** with AI at the core.#### **3. The Danger of Generic AI Solutions*** Off-the-shelf AI tools can lead to one-size-fits-all solutions that fail to differentiate.* AI works best when paired with deep domain expertise and a tailored strategy.* The future isn’t AI—it’s how businesses use AI uniquely.🛠 **Action:** Develop **custom AI applications** aligned with your company’s strengths and market positioning.#### **4. People + AI = The Ultimate Advantage*** AI is only as good as the people who manage it.* The best companies engage employees in AI adoption, experimentation, and innovation.* Leadership matters: Strong AI strategies come from the top down.🛠 **Action:** Invest in **AI training, leadership alignment, and cross-functional AI teams.**### **The Big Question: How Will You Use AI?****Ask yourself:**✅ How can AI **enhance your core business operations**?✅ How can AI be **baked into your products and services**?✅ What **unique data, knowledge, and expertise** give you an edge?The AI revolution isn’t about **having AI**—it’s about **how you use it to create value.** 🚀View image: ( ### Your daily AI dose 5 Reasons to join [Mindstream]( We’re the only AI newsletter you need* We’re so good HubSpot bought us (like they bought The Hustle)* 150,000+ strong community staying ahead of the curve* We’re actually fun to read* Written by an awesome team of real people, not AI tools[Click here to subscribe]( - you get a load of free stuff when you subscribeView image: ( View image: ( image link: ( 5. [Stop Treating AI Like a Cost Cutter—Or Get Left Behind]( picture is worth a thousand words—this graphic by Melissa Perri, perfectly illustrates the divide between AI winners and those stuck in outdated thinking.Companies that treat AI as just another cost-cutting tool—focusing solely on efficiency and outputs—risk falling behind. The real AI advantage lies in innovation, value creation, and an outcome-driven mindset.Winning the AI race isn’t just about adopting technology; it requires a full-scale transformation—culturally, organizationally, and operationally. That’s why so many companies struggle with AI—it’s not a plug-and-play solution; it’s a strategic shift. View image: ( View image: ( My favorite of all time!6. Sunday Funnies 🤣 .

[MEETING DELEGATE: Benchmarking LLMs on Attending Meetings on Our Behalf]( DELEGATE: Benchmarking LLMs on Attending Meetings on Our Behalf)The rise of LLM-powered meeting delegates presents an extraordinary opportunity to revolutionize workplace efficiency, allowing AI to attend meetings on our behalf. The research highlights how models like GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro can engage dynamically in conversations, summarizing discussions and responding in real-time. This could dramatically reduce meeting fatigue, free up cognitive bandwidth, and create a new paradigm for AI-driven collaboration. Yet, the technology is still nascent—current models capture only about 60% of key points accurately, and real-time engagement remains a challenge.The intrigue lies in AI’s potential to seamlessly integrate into human conversations, balancing active participation with appropriate silence. The benchmarking study reveals how different LLMs adopt varying engagement strategies—some more cautious, others overly assertive. This raises compelling questions: Could AI one day negotiate on our behalf? Could it understand corporate nuances better than employees themselves? The study even hints at the possibility of digital \"clones\" representing professionals in meetings, a vision that feels both futuristic and eerily plausible.But with great power comes great peril. The scariest prospect is AI\\'s susceptibility to errors—misinterpreting context, hallucinating facts, or failing to respect confidentiality. Transcription mistakes, privacy concerns, and over-reliance on imperfect AI could lead to misinformation, security risks, or even AI-generated \"ghosts\" in boardroom decisions. The research wisely advocates for a phased deployment approach, ensuring human oversight remains central. As we edge toward a world where AI manages our workplace interactions, we must balance efficiency with ethical responsibility, ensuring these digital delegates truly serve us, rather than replace us.View image: ( Until next time, take it one bit at a time!RobThank you for scrolling all the way to the end!

This is the first time I’ve been to the city, visiting for the [Newsletter Marketing Summit]( hosted by Matt McGarry, and I met A TON of interesting people. I have to shoutout a few of them for you. Let’s start with the Austin locals:* The day I arrived I went for a 7-mile walk around Lady Bird Lake with my friend [Zac Solomon]( meeting him in person for the first time. He hosts [ATX Writing Club]( is easily one of the most knowledgeable and dedicated community builders I know, and if you live in Austin he’s a great person to know. * I also met up with [Sam Ulu]( a long-time subscriber of this newsletter, Austin local, and former VC-backed founder now working at a Series B startup in Austin. * At Steph Smith’s meetup I met [TJ Larkin Jr]( who runs a couple of local newsletters in Austin.* [Kirtana Reddy]( writes [Selling Austin]( a local newsletter, and she’s monetizing it in a smart way - selling homes. She mentioned _half_ her home sales came through the newsletter, which blew my mind. * Last but not least (and I definitely didn’t mention _all_ of the locals I met), is Ethan Brooks of the [Austin Business Review]( another great local newsletter. If you live in Austin, I highly suggest meeting all of them. Makes me think I definitely need to come visit again soon. I also finally met a lot of my online friends and acquaintances in person, like [Chenell Basilio]( who writes one of my favorite newsletters, [Growth in Reverse]( [Daniel Berk]( who leads sales at Beehiiv and is crushing it with his new podcast, [Two Dads in Tech]( Manny Reyes who runs [Boletin Growth]( a newsletter growth agency, and so many others. View image: ( Today, we have a guest post from [Taylor Cromwell]( is a freelance writer, content strategist, and storyteller who helps MarTech, Sales, and other B2B SaaS companies showcase the real-world impact of their tools.Let’s dive in.--------------------View image: ( View image: ( ------------------------------**Jenny Doan isn’t your average YouTube star.**For starters, she’s in her 60s, and her main topic? Quilt tutorials.And yet, she’s the face of a $100M empire that has transformed a tiny rural town into what some call the “Disneyland of Quilting.”The secret to Missouri Star Quilt Company’s success? A three-part flywheel: Content → Commerce → Community. It’s a masterclass in how you can use content to fuel commerce and deepen community— and something more companies should be paying attention to in 2025.This is a story about how a small-town family bootstrapped their way to the top of an overlooked, multi-billion-dollar industry—creating not just a business, but a physical destination that thousands of quilters travel to every year.View image: ( [ how did they pull it off?Let’s start at the beginning — with a quilt, a one-year waitlist, and a son who saw a billion-dollar opportunity.View image: ( ## It All Started With a One-Year WaitlistIn 2008, Al Doan was in his mid-20s, working in tech startups and learning how to build businesses. He wasn’t thinking about quilting—until a conversation with his mom, Jenny, changed everything.Jenny had been quilting for years, but she wasn’t a professional. She just loved it. So when she wanted to get a quilt finished, she took it to a local quilt shop—and was told there was a one-year waitlist for long-arm quilting services.That number blew Al’s mind.“Wait—you’re telling me there’s so much demand that these places are booked an entire year in advance?”To him, that wasn’t just a minor inconvenience—**that was a business opportunity**.Al didn’t know much about quilting, but he did know that if people are willing to wait a year for something, they’ll definitely pay to get it done faster.So he did what any entrepreneur would do—he ran the numbers.* 💰 Long-arm quilting machines cost about $40,000* 💰 His sister had a house they could take a second mortgage on* 💰 If they could process just a few quilts a week, they could at least cover costs“We mortgaged my sister\\'s house. When I say we — she mortgaged her house, bought the machine. It\\'s like a $40,000 machine. It was a big buy, but we were very confident. All my market research was in that one call of it takes you a year? Okay, we\\'ll do this.“ — Al Doan, [The Nathan Berry Show]( 2024It wasn’t a grand business at the time. They just thought, “Let’s start a small quilting shop and see where it goes.”The initial idea was simple: Run a local quilting shop, just like thousands of others across America.The problem? Most quilt shops are small passion projects, run by retirees who just want wholesale fabric access. They barely break even.“Most quilt shops exist just to earn the right to exist.“ — Al Doan, [The Nathan Berry Show]( 2024Al quickly realized that model wasn’t enough to build something sustainable. They needed to do something different. Something bigger. And to do that, they needed outside customers—people beyond their small town of 1,500 residents.At the same time, Al lost his tech job, which pushed him into full time entrepreneurship.“I was 26. I was working with Symantec Corporation doing tech stuff and having a great time… but then I lost my job. When you lose your job, you\\'re like ‘I am an entrepreneur now. I\\'m fully committed. We\\'re going to do this.’“ — Al Doan, [The Nathan Berry Show]( 2024That’s when he decided to go all in on this quilting business. And first, they turned to YouTube.View image: ( ## Cracking the YouTube Code Before It Was CoolIt’s 2008. YouTube is barely a year old. There are no playbooks, no Mr. Beasts, no monetization strategies. Most people still saw it as a place for cat videos and home movie clips, not a legitimate business channel. It certainly wasn’t the obvious place for a quilting company to build an audience.But Al saw an opportunity; He saw a platform with unlimited reach, something that could take them far beyond the 1,500 residents of Hamilton, Missouri.He convinced his mom to **start filming free quilting tutorials**.At first, it was just an experiment. They didn’t have a detailed content strategy or a vision for how YouTube would drive business. It was more of a “let’s throw something at the wall and see if it sticks” approach. Al set up a camera, and Jenny started filming quilting tutorials.Jenny wasn’t a professionally trained quilter. She had taken a few local quilting classes but wasn’t the most technically skilled person in the craft.“Then my mom, as all the kids grew up and left the house, took up quilting by taking a class and just loved it. She thought it was very artistic and fun. She\\'s not a lifetime quilter. She\\'s not the most skilled quilter in the world.“ — Al Doan, [The Nathan Berry Show]( 2024That turned out to be an advantage. Unlike traditional quilting content, which was often dry and overly complicated, **Jenny’s tutorials felt accessible**. She spoke in plain language, broke things down into simple steps, and infused humor into the lessons.“I told Mom, ‘I’m not an idiot, but I have no idea what you’re saying. Explain it to me like I’m 5.’ And she did. That was the magic.“ — Al Doan, [Al’s Substack]( 2024Her warmth, humor, and ability to make quilting approachable resonated. But then the comments started pouring in. People weren’t just watching; they were making their first-ever quilts because of Jenny’s tutorials. They weren’t just engaging; they were buying the exact fabric she used in the videos.“This demographic had never had someone just love them. We didn’t even care if they bought anything — we were just giving them value.“ — Al Doan, [Growing Profitability]( Profitability) in 2024By 2013, Jenny was a YouTube star, and Missouri Star had crossed $4M in revenue.Youtube: Make a \"Sew Many Squares\" Quilt with Jenny Doan of Missouri Star (Video Tutorial) ( this was just the beginning. Because content wasn’t the endgame — it was the first step in a much bigger play.View image: ( ## Scaling Into a $4B IndustryMost people wouldn’t expect it, but quilting is big business. The industry generates $4 billion annually and has 12 million quilters in the U.S. alone.Yet despite its size, the market was fragmented. Most quilt shops were small, independently owned, and barely scraping by. These were passion projects by retirees, not scalable businesses.They weren’t thinking about e-commerce, digital marketing, or scalable business models.Again this was an opportunity for the Doan family, who were outsiders in more ways than way.“We always thought of ourselves as a tech company. None of our competitors were thinking that way.“ — Al Doan, [Growing Profitability]( Profitability) in 2024The Missouri Star Quilt Co. changed that. They used daily deal emails, YouTube-driven product promotions, and ready-to-quilt kits that simplified the buying process for beginners — all of which drove the growth of an e-commerce machine.View image: ( [ first, nothing really happened. But then that first year, we did about 100 grand in sales between a quilt shop that mom was in every day and this website that I was working on online. Then the next year, we did about a million in sales, and then 4 million, and then 8 million. Just really found some great appetite for it.“ — Al Doan, [The Nathan Berry Show]( 2024They experimented relentlessly, testing what worked and what didn’t.“‘Most people think too small’, he said. We knew there was so much more we could do.“ — Al DoanFor most small businesses, hitting a few million in revenue would be enough. But Missouri Star wasn’t content with just being a successful quilt shop. They wanted to compete at scale.The quilting industry had major players—Joann Fabric, Michaels, Hobby Lobby—who collectively controlled billions in annual sales. [For what it’s worth, Joann alone did $8 billion in revenue in 2024. They also filed bankruptcy in Jan. 2025]While these companies dominated retail, they lacked the direct connection to customers that Missouri Star had built.Instead of building products, **the company prioritized building relationships and community at its core**. That became their competitive advantage. Instead of trying to beat Joann’s on price or selection, Missouri Star doubled down on experience and engagement.By 2015, Missouri Star was the largest quilting company in the world — but their biggest move was still to come.View image: ( ## Building the ‘Disneyland of Quilting’As Missouri Star grew, something unexpected happened: **their audience wanted to visit them in person**. Their community felt a deep, real, tangible connection to the brand.--------------------——————————————————————————————————————————————————————Subscribe to Premium to read the rest.Become a paying subscriber to get access to this post and other subscriber-only content.Upgrade to paid: are reading a plain text version of this post.

       "  'body': ' Dear MoveOn member, We are watching what we never thought possible—the apparent transformation of our democracy into a dictatorship (or, as Trump has promoted, a monarchy with him as king).^1 The battle of our day is no longer about Democrats versus Republicans or left versus right. The choice right now is democracy or dictatorship. And we\\'re sliding faster than I ever thought possible into the latter. Everyone must choose which side they\\'re on. You may be feeling helpless, powerless, and alone. But you are not. Most Americans are as disgusted by this as you are. Trump and his billionaire friends want us to feel helpless, powerless, and alone—because that\\'s how Trump will take over. But tyranny cannot prevail over people who refuse to succumb to it. And something is beginning to happen. Boycotts are taking hold. Protests are on the rise. Federal courts are hitting back. The Trump-Musk-Vance regime\\'s popularity is plunging, and DOGE is losing credibility. In these dark times, people are starting to fight back. Ultimately, what happens to our country will come down to our own courage and resolve: To engage in peaceful protest. To organize and mobilize others. To work against hate and bigotry. To fight for justice and democracy. That\\'s why I\\'m writing to you today to ask you to support MoveOn, an organization I deeply admire and that has millions of members in every corner of our country. MoveOn can reach, train, support, organize, and communicate at a scale that is unparalleled in the progressive movement, and it does so with cutting-edge technology. We need MoveOn in this moment, now more than ever. Will you join me in starting a monthly donation of$5 to MoveOn to help them scale up their work to help bring about the downfall of the Trump-Musk-Vance regime while building the grassroots movement to build a better future for all of us? Your ongoing donation couldn\\'t be more important in these perilous times. [ ]Yes, I\\'ll chip in $5 a month. If you\\'ve saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately. [ ]No, I\\'m sorry, I can\\'t make a monthly donation. Make no mistake: Trump, Vance, and Musk continue to be an indiscriminate wrecking ball that has already caused major destruction and will continue to harm our communities and weaken and isolate America. But their takeover has been slowed. Their plan was based on doing so much, so fast that the rest of us would give in to negativity and despair. They want a dictatorship built on hopelessness and fear. That may have been the case initially, but we can take courage from the green shoots of rebellion now appearing across America and the world. Even so, the democracy movement now emerging will take years to rebuild and strengthen what has been destroyed, and to fix the raging inequalities, injustices, and corruption that led so many to vote for Trump a second time. Those of you who want the leaders of the Democratic Party to step up and be heard are right, of course. But political parties do not lead. The antiwar movement and the Civil Rights Movement didn\\'t depend on the Democratic Party for their successes. They depended on a mass mobilization of all of us who accepted the responsibilities of being American. More than 55 years ago, I participated in the resistance to the Vietnam War—a resistance that ultimately ended the war and caused a once-powerful president to resign. That resistance gave us courage we didn\\'t even know we had. Today, we will prevail because we are relearning the basic truth—that we are the leaders we\\'ve been waiting for. Join me, and help support MoveOn\\'s capacity to train, organize, and communicate with millions of us all across the country to stop the Trump-Musk-Vance regime and build a burgeoning America that serves all of us. Donate$5 a month. [ ]Yes, I\\'ll chip in $5 a month. If you\\'ve saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately. [ ]No, I\\'m sorry, I can\\'t make a monthly donation. It will be a very long and hard road forward. But we\\'re on it together. Thanks for all you do. –Robert Reich Source: 1. \"\\'Long Live the King\\': Trump Likens Himself to Royalty on Truth Social,\" The New York Times, February 23, 2025 Want to support MoveOn\\'s work? Donald Trump and his MAGA allies expect us to give up. But we will not give them what they want. We will never stop working to defend our fundamental freedoms and protect our democracy. MoveOn has been leading the movement against right-wing extremism for 26 years, and we promise you that we will still be here every step of the way forward. Will you start a monthly donation to sustain MoveOn\\'s work to protect our freedoms and democracy under Trump\\'s administration? [ ]Yes, I\\'ll chip in $5 a month.

Had to share [this one]( because c’mon—it’s _cats. _View image: ( image link: ( In all seriousness, video AI is getting _preeetty _convincing. ByteDance just released a [new paper]( for a model called Phantom that can generate video with consistent actors and products ([here’s 10 demos]( There’s [also Pika 2.1]( which is [ABSOLUTELY wild]( and has a new feature [called Pikadditions]( that does a similar thing. _In the (paraphrased) words of __[Roaring Kitty]( “__[we like the tool.]( _**Here’s what you need to know about AI today:*** Microsoft built an AI that generates legit gameplay videos. * Claude beat OpenAI models in developer coding benchmark.* Apple launched budget AI phone for $599.* Microsoft _also_ built a new quantum chip. Advertise in The Neuron here. ( image: ( # Microsoft just dropped a gaming AI that can “dream up” new gameplay videos.View image: ( Large language models (chatbots) are great, but it seems like we’re now in a waiting period before anything _really_ new comes out. Yeah, there’s Grok 3, but unless you’re an _Elon-stan_, that doesn’t mean much. _AI race heating up, competitors gaining on OpenAI, etc, etc. Been there, wrote that._**Let’s talk about what’s going on in AI **_**OUTSIDE **_**of language models…**And on that front, there’s some actually cool stuff going on. **Exhibit A:** Yesterday, Microsoft Research [revealed Muse]( their first AI model designed specifically for generating gameplay videos ([paper]( Muse is based on something Microsoft calls a “World and Human Action Model” (_WHAM!)_. Think of it like GPT, but instead of predicting the next word in a sentence, it predicts how a game world will respond to player inputs.Microsoft trained Muse on 7+ years of continuous gameplay data from a single game—[Bleeding Edge]( a_ _4v4 team brawler from Xbox\\'s Ninja Theory studio. That\\'s over a billion frames of gameplay and controller inputs, _FYI._**Here\\'s what makes Muse special:*** It takes a single game frame and generates multiple different ways the gameplay could continue.* It understands game physics and rules (_characters don\\'t walk through walls; gravity works properly_).* You can edit the scene (like adding new characters) and Muse will maintain those changes in the generated sequence.* You can even use a controller to guide where you want the character to go.The [demos]( are pretty cool. In one example, the researchers took a promotional image from Bleeding Edge, added an extra character that wasn\\'t there originally, and Muse generated a completely new sequence naturally incorporating that added character.View image: ( **Why this matters:** Game development is expensive and time-consuming. A tool that can quickly generate different gameplay scenarios could be huge for:* Game designers testing new ideas.* Developers creating training data for “[world model]( AI.* QA teams exploring edge cases.* Artists visualizing different character animations.**What\\'s next:** Microsoft is open-sourcing the model weights and demo app on [Azure AI Foundry]( This means other researchers and developers can start experimenting with it right away. While it currently only works with one game, imagine future versions that could…* Preserve classic games by learning their rules and recreating them for modern hardware.* Generate _NEW_ content for existing games or help designers prototype ideas.* Create endless variations of game levels for max replay value.**Our take:** The interesting thing here is the hard problem of generating interactive content that follows consistent rules. And the fact that Microsoft is open-sourcing it suggests they\\'re more interested in advancing the field than keeping the tech proprietary (_are you _[_shocked pikachu_]( Same)._The big question remains: Will Muse grow beyond a research demo into something game developers actually use? Game studios are notoriously cautious about new tech, but with Microsoft\\'s Xbox division already exploring ways to use it, we might see practical applications sooner than you think.

The best ones level the socioeconomic playing field ( You don\\'t need to buy something to feel like you belong. Parks ( and libraries ( are prime examples.I thought back to that issue when I read about Starbucks\\' new CEO, Brian Niccol, who recently told investors ( he wants to \"reclaim the \\'third place ( and make the chain\\'s \"cafes feel like welcoming coffeehouses.\" For context, Starbucks is not doing very well. Shares dropped 22% ( last year, and sales are down ( It\\'s had four CEOs since the pandemic. Now, it\\'s attempting a turnaround: \"Back to Starbucks ( the fact that a corporate coffee purveyor can\\'t do what true third places do best\\u200a-\\u200amake people feel welcome regardless of income (\\u200a-\\u200athe turnaround attempt is interesting to me. How does the world\\'s largest coffee chain (with over 40,000 locations globally) become \"a community center ( where each cup is, to quote Niccol, a \"handcrafted moment, made with care\"? How do you scale that vibe?One tactic: giving away free coffee ( Starbucks did this last Monday, post-Superbowl. Another: tackle the \"four minute\" problem, i.e. getting wait times down to four minutes or less, which Niccol seems fixated on ( (You can\\'t create community if people are grumpy and undercaffeinated!) Starbucks also may have started a meme ( capitalizing on a long-beloved (and roasted) aspect of its brand: baristas who misspell customers\\' names ( (possibly on purpose, maybe not). On TikTok, people are saying baristas have to write on the cups now, so they\\'re using them as canvases for Taylor Swift lyrics ( memes ( and the letter from The Notebook.Image Credit: @angelina.julia18 on TiktokThis attempt \"bespoke\" community-centrism reminds me of M.G. Siegler ( analysis ( of Barnes & Noble, which completed a similar turnaround ( over the last few years. \"Scale is power,\" Siegler writes, \"but you need to obfuscate that from the customer when it comes to retail.\" If you don\\'t, your product will feel soulless and customers will leave, which is exactly what\\'s happened to Starbucks over the last five years.\"Bespoke up front, scale in the back,\" he concludes. \"This sounds obvious, but the key to making this work is in the details\"\\u200a-\\u200awhich, depending on how you execute them, can feel either welcoming or inauthentic.- Harris Sockel⚡ 3 more storiesWill Leitch ( born one day before SNL\\'s premier on October 11, 1975, celebrates his 50th birthday along with the show… and articulates its key lesson: \"Just keep making stuff. Just keep doing it. It makes you irreplaceable. It makes you inevitable ( TV host Jabari Thomas ( encourages his younger self to \"build your own table ( instead of asking for a seat at one that will never welcome you.Cartoonist Sarah Firth ( writes (and draws) wisdom for creatives who can\\'t stop comparing themselves to others: You\\'re doing it because you want a benchmark ( for progress in an inherently uncertain career.⭐ Your daily dose of practical wisdomPeople differentiate themselves in three ways: agency (doing what you want), taste (liking things before other people do), or how you combine disparate skills ( (Dan Koe ( your understanding every day with the Medium Newsletter.

       "  'body': ' [ ]Sign the petition to tell MSNBC: DO NOT remove Joy Reid from prime time! Dear MoveOn member, In a move that fellow network host Rachel Maddow called \"indefensible,\" MSNBC announced this week that it was cancelling Joy Reid\\'s primetime show, \"The ReidOut.\"^1 Reid has been a loud and vocal critic of Donald Trump and his administration. We need Reid\\'s political analysis now as much as ever. We can\\'t sit back while prominent voices like hers are removed from the air. [ ]Will you sign the petition NOW to demand MSNBC reverse this unpopular decision? The cancellation of \"The ReidOut\" comes at a concerning time as the Trump administration ramps up its attacks on media outlets that criticize Trump and Elon Musk. It\\'s no surprise that Trump wasted no time following MSNBC\\'s announcement to denigrate Reid and the network on social media.^2Trump has previously threatened Comcast, NBC Universal\\'s parent company, accusing them of bias and warning that he will direct the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to investigate.^3MSNBC\\'s decision was made in a political climate that is deeply hostile to journalists, reporters, and analysts speaking out against Trump, and it contributes to the chilling effect we\\'re seeing across the industry. MSNBC firing Reid—who made history as its first primetime Black female anchor and is one of the most prominent Black political commentators—also coincides with Trump\\'s abuse of power eradicating diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts across the country. While Trump targets and dismantles programs like affirmative action that work to level the playing field, Reid has talked openly about how those same efforts supported her in her career and their importance more broadly.^4That\\'s why Reid is such a threat to Trumpism—she\\'s willing to use her platform to amplify the stories and experiences that Trump is trying to stifle. As the Trump administration attacks communities of color, we are calling on MSNBC to be firm in their support of their Black news anchors. We need diverse perspectives, analysis, and expertise—always, and especially during this second Trump administration. [ ]Tell MSNBC that its viewers value diversity and demand they bring back Joy Reid to prime time! We need to be louder than Donald Trump and conservatives who are attacking prominent political commentators like Joy Reid. Add your name to show your support for Reid and demand MSNBC keep her on air! [4]Sign the petition \"The ReidOut\" has been on air since 2020, and, while it has faced some valid criticism over the years, its abrupt ending is a disappointment to viewers who have looked to the show for its cutting interviews and relevant coverage. MSNBC also announced the cancellation of \"The Katie Phang Show\" and \"José Díaz-Balart Reports,\" though Phang and Díaz-Balart will stay with the network.^5Fellow MSNBC host Rachel Maddow spoke out against the decision, calling it a \"bad mistake\" and criticizing the network for removing the only two primetime shows hosted by anchors of color.^6 Reid\\'s spot will be replaced by \"The Weekend\" anchors Symone Sanders Townsend, Michael Steele, and Alicia Menendez.^7We welcome their perspectives and new show to prime time, but we refuse to accept a scarcity narrative that offers a false choice to viewers, especially when MSNBC has been repeatedly called out for its limited racial diversity.^8,9 [ ]Together, we can urge MSNBC to reverse its decision and reinstate \"The ReidOut\" immediately! Two large digital organizing groups, Win With Black Women and We Win With Black Men, swiftly organized support for Reid following MSNBC\\'s announcement and have been rallying against the decision. \"When we don\\'t speak up in these moments we continue to allow the line to be moved,\" said organizer Rashad Robinson.^10But we have to keep the pressure on MSNBC to make sure that its executives hear our concerns and take action. With more than a million viewers, MSNBC is one of the top trusted sources for news. We need them to do better and commit to amplifying diverse journalists and anchors, and investing in their shows. [ ]Click here to demand MSNBC bring back Joy Reid to prime time NOW and then share with three friends to help spread the word.

       "  'body': 'View this post on the web at week, we’re examining a “fearful mer-baby,” making art on a typewriter, cooking with rhubarb, and asking hypotheticals.VIDEODing!Sound on to enjoy the full, delightful experience of Erik Winkowski’s short film.The Written Image [ ]—Erik Winkowski in Paper Films When I bought a typewriter, I never intended to write with it. I wanted to make drawings.In truth, there’s not a big difference between writing and drawing. The alphabet began as pictograms, and over the course of 5,000 years, those pictures of ox heads, huts, and fish were simplified and abstracted into the letters we find on our keyboards today. I learned this in typography class back in art school, and it completely blew my mind. It still does. Just imagine what ancient images are lurking in this sentence.I bought a vintage sage-green Smith Corona typewriter off Etsy a few years ago, and it’s the most beautiful thing I’ve ever owned. Unfortunately, it’s spent most of that time sitting in its case, collecting dust. So last month, I decided I’d finally make some drawings with it.[...]I spent the next three days making typewriter drawings. I like using new tools that force me to work in a different way. A typewriter is stubborn, uncooperative, and utterly ridiculous as a drawing tool. And yet that’s what makes it fun. Every drawing feels like discovering something you didn’t know you were looking for.Keep watching [ ]ARTCreative libertiesIn which Nathalie Olah considers “Play of the Nereides” by Arnold Böcklin—or, as she calls it, “the worst painting in the world.”The worst painting in the world [ ]—Nathalie Olah in sacred and profane “Play of the Nereides” by Arnold Böcklin (1886) is two metres wide and almost as tall. In Greek mythology, the Nereids are fifty benevolent sea nymphs who often appear alongside Poseidon. Here we see just seven of them, not counting a possible baby sea nymph who is also shown clinging to a fish. I am not a classicist and would like to know if this scene is from a particular story. What I do know is that four of the mermaids are anatomically impossible. One of them is cut off mid-fin by the edge of the painting. The rock at the centre of the image defies all laws of space. It is both cave and monolith—close by and very, very far away. The only realistic element of the painting (and Böcklin is aiming for a realism of sorts, just not in his subject matter) is the lasciviousness of two men captivated by the mermaids’ sopping breasts. One of these men has a sort of Cabbage Patch quality, while the other resembles the parking lot guy from Mulholland Drive.[...]Böcklin is Swiss and actually from Basel, so that goes some way to explain why the gallery chose to display so many of his works, including those that strayed from the more austere paintings of his earlier career. Still, awestruck by what I had seen, after leaving the gallery I messaged a friend who had lived in Basel for many years. He knew the painting well and was fond of the fearful mer-baby. “Imagine painting that,” he said. “What must be going through your head?” The answer was probably very little, or at least very little conscious thought. Böcklin was not a good painter, and his interests veered towards the cornier end of the corny nineteenth century. From a scan of his Wikipedia page I also found out that he would travel to Italy, making the following statement a bit of stretch; but I like to imagine that beneath the stiff formality and conservatism of Swiss society, and a landlocked nation whose large, placid lakes have never known turbulence, lurks a desire for errant bodies and crashing waves.Keep reading [ ]PHOTOGRAPHYPROSEA Sixth Finger [ ]—emma girl in my vape is dying If there were a mandated monogamy law—if, tomorrow, it became illegal to be single and unwed: Would you choose me?

All I want in life is to be loved and it seems programmed in me—not by nature nor nurture but some inexplicable force only I am burdened with—that I either deny this truth or settle for less. It’s a fucking illness, it’s a burden, and it’s all I am. Despite that, everything is moving and bending and breathing and crumpling at all times. Stillness is a bedtime story, a children’s fable. To move with the world is a gift only granted to the gods but to move in spite of the world is a technique we all harness. We move not because we want to move or need to move, we move because it’s all we know how to do. Every time I move closer to you, the universe bends its arms back. When I move away from you, the universe clenches its teeth to dust. The rare times I move inside myself, the universe is fearful as to make any movement at all, but since it must, it folds its knees into its chest so everyone can hear the heartbeat. I could never be a waitress or a surgeon because I have shaky hands. You could never be my lover or my friend because that would require a person to exist outside of your own head. See—we both have our faults. I remember dancing with women who were not my friends in places I didn’t know the name of. That’s because, sometimes, movement is involuntary—it can be mechanical and sweeping and despotic. Your version of that is dancing with women whose names you don’t know in places you’ve grown tired of. Every man talks to me like I’m a man, or worse, like a friend. I’ve never felt the urge to be friends with a man, not in that way, no—it feels like a mild death. It feels like an endless chore and a rotten sense of responsibility. It feels like the easiest way to make me think poorly about myself but I’m a creative person so I have already found enough ways to do that. I want to feel like a sixth finger: perfect and necessary in humor and in beauty but not in biology. But you don’t get that—or do you? I need you to know that everything I say is meaningless and important at the same time or else I can’t fall in love with you. When the bath is numbingly hot but you get in anyway and your skin only glows hot pink once you step out, not while you’re in it. Is that a metaphor? I’m not mad or poetic, I know that’s what you’re thinking; everything I’m saying is truthful and justified and pastoral in spirit. But if those words make you feel better, I don’t mind.Keep reading [ ]ILLUSTRATIONHOLLYWOODAwards seasonAs the film industry prepares for its biggest night, Liz Goldwyn—yes, of the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Goldwyns—reflects on her “love/hate relationship with Hollywood.”You’ll Never Eat Lunch in This Town Again [ ]—Liz Goldwyn in STARF*CKER It’s Oscar week and I’m in L.A. This fills me with anxiety, the stench of social climbing hangs thick in the air and your place on the totem pole is never so clear (let’s call mine negative 568 at the moment). Even nominees are ready for the long slog of shaking hands that started last fall (or summer if their film premiered at Cannes) to be over.Though I may recoil from it, I still love the smell of Oscar week hustle, even if, in the aftermath of the fires and a White House that hates Hollywood, this season has a more muted fragrance.The last time I was in town was during Golden Globes week, just before everything went even more to shit. But as the song goes, there’s no people like show people, they smile when they are low … a saying that my father drilled into me from the time I could sing along. Dad’s best friend growing up was Mary Ellin Berlin, daughter of Irving Berlin, the songwriter of “There’s No Business Like Show Business.” When I was born, Irving gave me a necklace of a single pearl surrounded by three tiny diamonds which my parents allowed me to wear once I turned 16. I never took it off until a bad car accident broke my ribs in my 30s and I accidentally left it in a chiropractor’s office during an adjustment, never to be seen again. Ever since my dad died, whenever I hear the song come on, I think of him talking to me through the sound waves—You’re broken-hearted / But you go on—and I shed a (real) showbiz tear.I acknowledge my love/hate relationship with Hollywood, aware that as much as I reject it, I secretly want to be accepted. The other day someone texted asking if I was “hosting the Future Perfect party at the ‘Goldwyn’ house tonight?” which sums up my insider/outsider status. Not only was I unaware of said party, my grandad lived a mere few years at the location they are marketing as the “Goldwyn House.” The real “Goldwyn House,” that my grandparents built, in which both my dad and I grew up, is now owned by Taylor Swift. So there you have it in a nutshell—apparently I am not cool enough to merit an invite to a party which is being sold using the “glamour” of my own last name.Welcome to Hollywood, folks.Keep reading [ ]PAINTINGFOODRhubarb seasonThere have been some stunning rhubarb-focused recipes appearing across Substack in the past couple of weeks. Sarah’s ode to rhubarb for A Good Table offers several approaches to the vegetable, from chamomile, lemon, and rhubarb scones to mini rhubarb, rose, blood orange, and pistachio baked Alaskas.Celebrating rhubarb [ ]—Sarah in A Good Table Blushing pink against the season’s monochrome, it arrives like a quiet rebellion to the lingering chill. Its slender stalks, vivid as watercolor brushstrokes, cut through the grey with a brightness that holds promise. The vegetable’s acidity, tamed by sugar and spice, softens into something lush and deeply comforting. If the season refuses to turn, we’ll summon its warmth ourselves, one mouthful at a time.This week’s newsletter is, once again, a love letter to sugar, laden with rhubarb in all its tart, fragrant glory.The recipes take inspiration from bakeries and restaurants in both New York and London. Some lean into the art of slow, weekend cooking, such as the mini pistachio, blood orange and rose rhubarb baked Alaska. This was inspired by a particularly lovely Valentine’s dinner my husband and I enjoyed at Spring, in London. Others are simpler, more immediate pleasures: chamomile, lemon zest and rhubarb biscuits (or scones, if you’re English), dipped in a blood orange and rhubarb glaze, then crowned with a jewel-like sliver of stewed rhubarb—perfect with a cup of tea.We’re also exploring ingredients that pair well with rhubarb, especially when they make the most of its versatility. One example of this is where a homemade rhubarb syrup does double (or triple) duty, appearing in a rhubarb and grapefruit fizz cocktail with plenty left over to drizzle on ice cream, use in jellies, or as a glaze for tarts.Keep reading [ ]MUSIC MACHINESubstackers featured in this editionArt & Photography: Manu Montoya , Lexi Brown , Hadley Greene , Ben Sims Video & Audio: Erik Winkowski , David Watts Writing: Nathalie Olah , emma girl , Liz Goldwyn , Sarah Recently launchedInspired by the writers featured in the Weekender?

So, I gave it a few claps and highlighted a few sections that stood out to me.You’ve clearly got a natural talent for communicating in a way that’s easy to understand. But, if I had to guess, you’re looking to take your writing even further. For example, growing a newsletter, becoming a recognized thought leader, or landing high-paying consulting gigs by showcasing your expertise. I’ve helped writers do exactly that. Over the past six years, I’ve built an audience of 50,000+ across Medium and Substack and used writing to open doors to new career opportunities, partnerships, and income streams. So, I’d love to offer you personalized writing mentorship. During our time together, I’ll provide feedback on your articles, focusing on how to make your writing more aligned with your career goals. Plus, we’ll have bi-weekly Zoom calls where I’ll provide ongoing support and help you navigate any challenges.Would you find mentorship helpful? If so, let me know, and I’d be happy to provide more details.Have a wonderful day, Alexander, and talk soon,Matt LillywhiteWriting Portfolio:Medium | Substack ',\n",

Each video post reaches subscribers instantly through email, app notifications, or both, ensuring a direct connection with their audience. Learn more about posting in the app in the announcement post [ ].Live Video recording enhancements: To make publishing even easier, we’ve introduced automated enhancements, which refine your recorded live video by trimming dead space at the beginning, enhancing audio and video quality, and reformatting the layout into a polished side-by-side view. This ensures that your video looks professional and is ready to share with minimal effort.Live video viewing on desktop: Viewers can now watch live videos on their computer, increasing accessibility and providing more opportunities for engagement and feedback on live videos.Notes stats in the app: Previously only available on the web, Notes stats can now be accessed directly in the app. Publishers can track key insights, including estimated revenue increase, new paid and free subscribers, and interaction metrics like shares, profile visits, and likes.ResourcesLaunch a live video show: Live video [ ] is taking off on Substack, with more creators making it a regular part of their programming.

GPT-4.5 System Card Watching: GPT-4.5 (paper/my summary) Jeremy Howard on GPT-4.5. Source. What problem does it solve? There’s a fundamental tension in AI development between two competing paradigms: scaled unsupervised learning (which builds extensive \"world knowledge\" but may lack reasoning depth) versus sophisticated reasoning approaches (which excel at problem-solving but might have less breadth of knowledge). Models like GPT-4.5 represent the former approach, while systems like o3 appear to represent the latter. This dichotomy has created a debate about which path will ultimately lead to more capable AI systems. How does it solve the problem? OpenAI tries to address this by following a dual-track strategy where they simultaneously advance scaled unsupervised learning through GPT-4.5 while developing reasoning capabilities through other models (like o3). Rather than viewing these as competing approaches, they frame them as complementary paths that will eventually converge. What are the key findings? While GPT-4.5 may currently be underwhelming relative to its cost for many practical applications, its importance lies not in immediate utility but in its role as a building block for future AI systems. The next breakthrough will come from unsupervised learning approaches converging with sophisticated reasoning capabilities, creating systems that can both leverage vast knowledge and perform complex step-by-step reasoning—a combination that would represent a transformative advance. Why does it matter? This OpenAI release has a weird vibe to it and one can not help but think that their hand might have been forced by the big releases from their competition. According to them, GPT-4.5 isn’t supposed to be a breakthrough itself, but rather an enabler of one. Judging by how performant their existing reasoning model series turned out to be - which was based on GPT-4 - there’s a realistic chance that there’s some substance to their argument. So, if we believe their story, then GPT-4.5 would indeed play a very important rule. That’s a big if though. Note: if you’re thinking about using GPT-4.5 for AI agents, I would recommend to check out the agent leaderboard from Galileo AI. 2. Phi-4-Mini Technical Report: Compact yet Powerful Multimodal Language Models via Mixture-of-LoRAs Watching: Phi-4-Mini (paper/my summary) What problem does it solve? They address the challenge of creating compact yet highly capable language and multimodal models. As AI systems grow increasingly complex, there\\'s a significant need for smaller models that can still perform sophisticated tasks without requiring massive computational resources. Specifically, the researchers sought to build models under 6B parameters that could match or exceed the performance of much larger models on complex reasoning, math, coding, and multimodal understanding tasks - a capability that would enable deployment in more resource-constrained environments. How does it solve the problem? The Microsoft researchers developed two models: Phi-4-Mini (3.8B parameters) and Phi-4-Multimodal (5.6B parameters). For Phi-4-Mini, they trained on carefully curated high-quality web and synthetic data with emphasis on reasoning-rich content and code datasets. For Phi-4-Multimodal, they introduced a novel \"mixture-of-LoRAs\" technique that allows multiple inference modes combining various modalities without interference. This approach keeps the base language model entirely frozen while adding modality-specific capabilities through separate LoRA adapters and routers, enabling efficient handling of text, vision, and speech/audio inputs in various combinations without degrading performance in any single modality. What are the key findings? They found that despite its compact size, Phi-4-Mini significantly outperforms recent open-source models of similar size and matches models twice its size on math and coding tasks. Phi-4-Multimodal ranks first on the OpenASR leaderboard despite having a speech/audio component of just 460M parameters. It demonstrates strong performance across vision-language tasks, often outperforming larger models, and supports combined modality scenarios like vision+language, vision+speech, and speech/audio inputs. An experimental reasoning-enhanced version of Phi-4-Mini achieves performance comparable to or surpassing specialized reasoning models with 7-8B parameters on complex mathematical reasoning tasks like AIME and MATH-500. Why does it matter? Phi-4-Mini demonstrates that smaller, more efficient models can achieve performance levels previously thought to require much larger models when trained with high-quality data and specialized techniques. This has profound implications for democratizing access to advanced AI capabilities in resource-constrained environments like mobile devices and edge computing. The modular LoRA-based approach to multimodal integration provides a blueprint for efficiently extending models to new capabilities without retraining the entire system. This enables more practical, accessible, and resource-efficient AI applications without sacrificing performance quality. 3. BIG-Bench Extra Hard Watching: BIG-Bench (paper/code) What problem does it solve? Current LLM reasoning benchmarks have hit a ceiling, particularly BIG-Bench Hard (BBH), where state-of-the-art models now achieve over 90% accuracy. This saturation means these benchmarks can no longer effectively differentiate between the reasoning abilities of the latest LLMs. Additionally, most existing reasoning benchmarks disproportionately focus on mathematical and coding abilities, neglecting the broader spectrum of reasoning skills needed for real-world applications. BBH itself had several limitations: high random chance performance (due to many binary-choice questions), potential shortcuts for solving problems without proper reasoning, short input contexts (averaging only 700 characters), and relatively shallow reasoning depth. How does it solve the problem? The authors created BIG-Bench Extra Hard (BBEH), replacing each of BBH\\'s 23 tasks with significantly more challenging counterparts that test similar reasoning capabilities but require deeper thinking. They employed a semi-adversarial approach, iteratively increasing task difficulty until even frontier models struggled (below 70% accuracy). BBEH features substantially longer inputs (6x longer on average), requires more complex reasoning (outputs are 7x longer), and tests additional skills including many-hop reasoning, learning on the fly, identifying errors in reasoning chains, processing long contexts, finding needles in haystacks, and dealing with distractors. The benchmark also reduces the random chance baseline and eliminates shortcuts that previously allowed models to solve problems without proper reasoning. What are the key findings? BBEH reveals substantial headroom for improvement in LLM reasoning capabilities. The best general-purpose model achieved only 9.8% harmonic mean accuracy, while the best reasoning-specialized model reached 44.8%. Reasoning-specialized models like o3-mini (high) showed their greatest advantages on formal problems involving counting, planning, arithmetic, and algorithms, but demonstrated limited progress on \"softer\" reasoning skills like commonsense, humor, sarcasm, and causation understanding. Similarly, larger models showed more improvement on tasks requiring many-hop reasoning or algorithm application, but less on tasks related to human-like understanding. The analysis also revealed that gains from reasoning specialization increased with both context length and reasoning complexity. Why does it matter? Their work highlights crucial gaps in current LLM development. As these models are increasingly deployed in everyday applications, they need robust reasoning across diverse domains - not just in mathematics and formal logic. BBEH provides a more comprehensive assessment of general reasoning abilities by testing skills required for complex real-world scenarios. The results suggest a concerning imbalance: while significant progress has been made in formal reasoning capabilities, other equally important reasoning domains remain underdeveloped. This benchmark offers concrete guidance for future research, revealing where models struggle most and what capabilities need strengthening.

       "  'timestamp': '2025-02-28 09:45:03-08',\n",
       "  'body': 'View this post on the web at anticipation of the Oscars this Sunday, we spent some time parsing reviews of the year’s Best Picture nominees. Here, Substackers weigh in on the contenders, the controversies, and the predictions to determine which movie will take home the biggest little gold guy.A Complete UnknownVince Mancini [ ]: A Complete Unknown has the weird distinction of being a lot better than I thought it would be and not nearly good enough to be nominated for Best Picture.Hundred Tomatoes [ ]: “The Bob Dylan Movie, starring Timothée Chalamet,” aka James Mangold’s “A Complete Unknown,” starts in New York during the year 1961. Against the backdrop of a vibrant music scene and tumultuous cultural upheaval, an enigmatic 19-year-old from Minnesota arrives with his guitar and revolutionary talent, destined to change the course of American music. He forges intimate relationships with music icons of Greenwich Village on his meteoric rise, culminating in a groundbreaking and controversial performance that reverberates worldwide.Sonny Bunch [ ]: It’s a perfectly pleasant movie and Timothée Chalamet is quite good in it, but it never really rises above pleasingly competent.Vince Mancini [ ]: Hearing Dylan break into “The Times They Are a-Changin’” gave me goosebumps—just to imagine a time when the words could ring broadly true, and not ironic in the face of a senile gerontocracy.AnoraChris Williams [ ]: Few people humanize the people who fall through society’s cracks like Sean Baker does.Susan Bordo [ ]: I love Anora and I’m hoping that for the first time in many years my choice will be in step with the Academy’s.Travis Scott [ ]: Sean Baker’s story of a sex worker who unwittingly falls for the son of a Russian oligarch is equal parts funny, touching, and tragic, with probably the best performance of the year from Mikey Madison.Gabriel Miller [ ]: Anora is a rare film where the protagonist doesn’t know what genre of movie they’re in, and that creates a propulsive drive throughout each movement of the script, which ignites her character change.In the beginning, she believes she’s in a gritty drama when, in fact, the movie is played like a fairy-tale romance.In the middle, she believes she’s in that fairy-tale romance when, in fact, the movie has transitioned to a crime thriller.By the end, when she is emotionally torn to ribbons, she believes she is in a prison drama when, in fact, she is part of a slow-burn romance.Sonny Bunch [ ]: It’s heartfelt and funny and just jaundiced enough to keep from getting sappy; this is a movie that does not have a storybook ending because life is not a fairy tale.Asli [ ]: After sitting on it, [Anora] didn’t stick with me the way I expected it to. I think the characters, especially Ani, fell flat and were too one-dimensional. Yes, the final scene was wonderful, but it wasn’t enough, and it was too late.The BrutalistInkoo Kang [ ]: [The Brutalist is] not just my favorite film of 2024. It was the most exciting kind of feature there is for me—the kind that makes me excited about the cinematic medium and its possibilities.Abhinav Yerramreddy [ ]: Shot in glorious VistaVision, The Brutalist remains true to its period settings while approaching the American Dream with a grimy undercurrent, examining the juxtaposition between the hope of America and the underlying traumas of the immigrant experience.Eddie Huang [ ]: There wasn’t a single second of this film I wasn’t engaged, despite the fact that the entire narrative revolves around the erection of a building. Stare at me crazy all you want, but the film of the decade is a 3-hour HGTV epic set in post-World War II DOYLESTOWN, PENNSYLVANIA.Sonny Bunch [ ]: The first half of this movie is one of the best movies of the year, a gut-wrenching portrait of immigration, assimilation, the push and pull between capital and art, and the underbelly of the American Dream. Unfortunately, there’s a second half.Vince Mancini [ ]: I like to think of The Brutalist as a more house-trained Emilia Pérez. Certainly it’s a lot more successful at genuinely epic filmmaking (and would be worth it for that alone), but it’s also true that a lot of its appeal is making me wonder what the hell I just watched.ConclaveKarla Marie Sweet [ ]: When Isabella Rossellini appeared on-screen, I literally said “Are you kidding me?” out loud because, wow, this is such a superstar cast. Lucian Msamati, John Lithgow, Stanley Tucci, and Ralph Fiennes (are you kidding me?) play four cardinals who have assembled (along with dozens of others) to vote for a new pope after the previous dies suddenly.Natalia Albin Legorreta [ ]: Conclave knows what it’s doing and it’s confident with it—the comedic timing that doesn’t feel like comedy, the gossip sessions thinly veiled as very-Vatican-serious-conversations, the third-act twist … it’s delicious.Vince Mancini [ ]: After 20 minutes of watching guys in robes be passive-aggressive to each other, I thought “Is this going to be all there is?” And then for two more hours that was all it was, and yet I was riveted.Karla Marie Sweet [ ]: I loved the use of colour in this film, how so many shots look like paintings and how much I learned about the process of the vote. It’s a fascinating insight into a small, seldom seen community of clerics.Dune Part 2Travis Clark [ ]: [N]o movie represented the highs of the theatrical experience last year [better] than “Dune: Part Two,” a sci-fi epic on a grand scale that tops its (also superb) predecessor in nearly every way.Vince Mancini [ ]: [E]verything I saw was mind-blowing and eye-popping and shit-button-puckering and all of the adjectives. It was good! And yet good in a way that a year later, I don’t have much to say about it.Asli [ ]: I know Dune: Part Two is one of the least likely films to win in this list, but it’s definitely in the top for me. The Academy hates genre films, but this doesn’t change the fact that both parts of Dune have been some of the most influential films in recent times.Emilia PérezJohn Paul Brammer [ ]: Emilia Pérez has been called many things: Offensive. Misguided. Overrated. Regressive queer representation. An inaccurate portrayal of Mexican culture. Musically unpleasant. Bad at Spanish. Honestly, it sounds a lot like me.Chris Williams [ ]: Jacques Audiard’s film is many things, but boring isn’t one of them.Vince Mancini [ ]: Suffice it to say, it’s a Spanish-language musical set in Mexico starring mostly non-Mexican actors and directed by a Frenchman, featuring a plot about a drug lord getting a sex change and then redeeming herself by helping cartel victims’ families find their loved ones’ bodies. Oh, and then the “lead” actress (not really, but she was nominated that way) was discovered to have said some nice things about Hitler. And then compared herself to Jesus and civil rights martyrs in the apology tour. So, yeah. “Controversy.”John Paul Brammer [ ]: None of this blowback would be happening had the film not racked up a truly bewildering thirteen Oscar nominations, making it the most nominated film of the year. Its critical success raises questions. Questions like: Why? and Did you watch it? I kind of feel bad for Emilia Pérez. I don’t think it was supposed to get this many accolades. They piled too many awards on it, and it’s collapsing under the weight of its trophies. It’s just not a movie that can hold up to this level of scrutiny.I’m Still HereAbhinav Yerramreddy [ ]: Not many people had I’m Still Here making it into the Best Picture Top 10 earlier this year, but here we are.Natalia Albin Legorreta [ ]: I love nearly everything Walter Salles did with this story about the Paiva family during Brazil’s military dictatorship in 1964.Chris Williams [ ]: This is why the Oscars are so important. I hadn’t heard hardly anything about Walter Salles’s drama—also nominated for Best International Feature—until it began collecting nominations. I’m glad I was alerted to it, because it’s one of last year’s best films, an emotional epic about the defiant act of living a normal life in a state of oppression.Asli [ ]: I was very moved by I’m Still Here, but even more so by Fernanda Torres and her performance. This movie relies heavily on the actors—on their performances and especially on their chemistry. And there isn’t a second where any of that is less than perfect.Nickel BoysTravis Clark [ ]: A bulldozer of a movie that generated a few hushed “wow”s in my theater as the credits rolled. RaMell Ross’s adaptation of Colson Whitehead’s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel is told in a first-person POV style that isn’t a gimmick but a fully realized expression of the film’s narrative. It took a bit for it to win me over, but it soon washes over you. Now I can’t imagine it any other way.Asli [ ]: Nickel Boys was gut-wrenching. I couldn’t look away—literally and figuratively. I’m still not sure how I feel about the first-person perspective, but I love that the director took an unconventional and original approach to this story.Chris Williams [ ]: I wish I loved Nickel Boys as much as many other critics do.Abhinav Yerramreddy [ ]: Ultimately, Nickel Boys feels more like an intellectual exercise than an emotionally resonant story.The SubstanceHundred Tomatoes [ ]: The Substance brilliantly explores the dangers of attempting to overcompensate for societal beauty standards with excellent acting while simultaneously scarring me for life in the process.Lora Dailey [ ]: [It’s] The Picture of Dorian Gray on ayahuasca. The younger alter ego, Sue, drains the life force from the older Elisabeth, abusing the Substance to the point where her body literally falls apart. But it doesn’t end there, as the final half-hour is an over-the-top gore fest with a deformed female figure literally described as a “monster.”Chris Williams [ ]: I may not love The Substance, but I love that it’s nominated for Best Picture. Imagining old fuddy-duddy Oscar voters sitting through this movie’s Troma-adjacent final moments fills me with glee.WickedAsli [ ]: Seriously, Wicked for Best Picture?Jenny Gorelick [ ]: I cried just as much in the theater as Cynthia and Ari did on the press circuit.Chris Williams [ ]: I’m glad Wicked is good and I hope it means we get more musicals. I’m glad it found an audience. But in terms of recognition, to quote Don Draper: That’s what the money’s for.So, what’s gonna win?Clare [ ]: It’s a particularly interesting year, I would say, especially in contrast to last year’s snoozefest (predictable + Anatomy of a Fall 😴). Not because the nominated movies are better (they’re just slightly worse) but because they are just a little unwieldy.Gabriel Miller [ ]: Anora had a triple win this weekend. Top Award at the Directors Guild of America (DGA), Producers Guild of America (PGA), and Critics Choice Awards. This trio of wins puts Anora as the front-runner for the Oscars, as there is a significant crossover between the PGA/DGA voting bodies and Academy voters.More importantly, when all three voting bodies align, as happened with Oppenheimer, Everything Everywhere All at Once, Nomadland, and The Shape of Water, the film went on to win the Best Picture Oscar.Allie L. [ ]: Anora is the current front-runner, but not as much of a lock as recent winners like Parasite (2019) and Everything Everywhere All At Once (2022) were. I think The Substance has a shot, especially for its contrast in theme and tone to last year’s winner, Oppenheimer.Vince Mancini [ ]: Conclave feels like a good-value dark horse, but the simple fact of me typing that ensures that it won’t happen. Did I reverse jinx myself by typing that second sentence? Maybe! Go sacrifice a goat and see what its guts tell you!Not Jess [ ]: I don’t know why I’ve put full stock in The Brutalist winning here. It just is an energy that I’ve always felt. I know there’s a lot working in Anora’s favor, so perhaps I should cast my net wider to one or the other … it just feels like depending on the show, Anora either gets a lot of love or absolutely none.Unsubscribe ',\n",

       "  'body': 'Hi everyone,This week, we answer more of your career questions! I\\'ll tackle:* Whether to stay in US AI policy ( under a new administration* How to think about AI’s coming impacts ( on your career prospectsAlso, we’d love your feedback on this new advice column format — do you like it, hate it, find it helpful? Should we keep going? Let us know what you think ( .Question one: I\\'m a junior studying computer science at a good state school (3.7 GPA). I\\'ve done a couple standard tech internships and have decent coding projects, but nothing amazing. Everyone keeps talking about how AGI is going to automate basically all jobs and/or kill us within 3 years.I\\'m worried I\\'m totally screwed — by the time I graduate next year, will there even be entry level jobs left? Should I just give up trying to build a resume and coast through my last year?I know the standard advice is \"just keep learning and preparing\" but it feels pointless if I\\'m going to graduate into a world where AIs can do everything better than me anyway. Help?Laura: This is a difficult question, but I think it’s important to ask. I certainly don’t have all the answers, because the future is uncertain — perhaps especially now.That said, I do think there are sensible steps to take to navigate the trajectory of AI and its global impactFirst, let\\'s address the immediate concern about the job market. While AI is already changing the landscape of work, entry-level jobs haven’t disappeared. The 80,000 Hours job board has hundreds of entry-level openings ( , and other job sites will have many more. I expect there will still be plenty of jobs available when you graduate, even as AI continues to advance quickly.As technology becomes better at the tasks that human workers perform, there are typically significant delays before it is widely adopted ( . Still, the economy will likely change as AI gets more powerful, and that may start happening in just a few years. So, my advice is to stay ahead of the adoption curve. Master prompting and evaluation techniques to ensure the quality of outputs. Learn to set up AI task automation systems. Experiment with new tools and applications.You should still finish your degree, and aim for decent grades, but I wouldn’t prioritise credentials for the sake of credentials. Instead, focus on building skills that will take longer to delegate to AI systems: strategic thinking, decision making, prioritisation, and relationship-building.While I do expect AI will likely continue to advance rapidly in the next few years, it’s also important to remember that nothing is guaranteed. AI progress could stall, and you definitely still want to be employable if that happens!But, at some point, AI systems will likely be able to do everything a human can do faster, cheaper, and better. What then?This will be a wild world, and it comes with tons of risks. We’ve written a lot about the dangers, including power-seeking AI ( , catastrophic misuse ( , great power war ( , and issues around the moral status of digital minds ( .I worry we’re not precisely on track to address the risks, so we’ve also written about ways you can help mitigate AI risks, including:* Pursuing careers in AI policy ( , AI technical safety ( , or information security ( , among many others ( Spreading awareness through roles in communicating important ideas ( and journalism ( Researching what society should do in a world transformed by advanced AI ( many people, thinking about how to be relevant in a world with rapidly advancing AI could involve working on efforts to help the transition to a world with transformative AI go well. I recommend staying close to the technology by learning about AI developments, risks, and the proposed solutions.Focus on reading widely, connecting with people in the field, and forming your own opinions on promising interventions — whether in policy, communications, or technical research. You don’t need to wait until graduation to start. And once you finish your degree, there will still be plenty of questions to answer and ways, both big and small, to contribute.I wish we didn’t have any work to do. What a great problem to have that\\'d be!Question two: With the new administration trying to dismantle the US federal government, what should be my next steps in my career? Should I try to stay in federal service? I have been a federal employee for almost 4 years working in the AI governance and policy space. But now my career opportunities are much less certain.Even before all of the recent turmoil, I was doubting my effectiveness for making change and upholding responsible AI practices in my current role (I\\'m not in leadership position). I also have a huge interest in food and food systems so I was considering a lateral move to the USDA. But now I\\'m wondering if I should move into the private or nonprofit sectors, at least for the next 4 years. Or should I stay steadfast to my federal career until it is taken from me?Laura: That sounds like a very difficult position. I think staying in federal service, if possible, could be worth it, though there are certainly other impactful opportunities for you.US AI policy might be the most important lever for reducing global catastrophic risks from AI in the near future ( .The US government also doesn’t have many staff with a deep understanding of AI and its risks. Given the current political climate, this shortage may worsen. Your four years of experience in US AI policy is certainly not trivial, so even without a leadership position, I think you likely have a lot to contribute where you are.It\\'s been a wild ride in 2025 — and we\\'re only two months in. While some chaos and uncertainty will likely continue, I also expect some gradual stabilisation in the government.I understand the frustration of working under so much uncertainty. But if you want to bet on your career having an impact, staying in the government and working on AI policy could make sense.If you do decide to stay, you should definitely invest in taking care of yourself and avoiding burnout ( . Job insecurity and a challenging work environment can really take its toll. I’d recommend connecting with others in a similar situation — either in government or in AI policy — for support. It can also be really helpful to discuss your frustrations with friends, family, or a therapist.That said, I don’t think you should make yourself miserable if this job is unsustainable for you — it’s crucial to take care of yourself and your own needs.There are also important nonprofits, think tanks, and research institutes with attractive opportunities for you. The 80,000 Hours job board currently has openings ( with the RAND Corporation, Brookings Institution, and the Secure AI Project, just to name a few. These organisations may value your experience and offer good opportunities for career growth if you need to leave government for now. (Though competition for these roles may be high right now, as other federal employees might also be looking to exit.)I’d be less inclined to suggest the USDA route — AI policy is already a very important area where you have substantial work experience, and it’s not clear to me you’d benefit from switching paths. I’m not sure the USDA will actually be more stable or impactful than other parts of government in the foreseeable future. Though it’s possible there are other reasons for making the switch I’m not aware of.Whether you decide to stay or try something new, thank you for your contributions.------------------------------------------------------------Announcements:* We will be hiring more writer-researchers to our team in the near future!

Register here to attend sessions offered by world leaders including Keynote by NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang, discover new trends and products in GenAI, participate in workshops covering many modern topics leading to certifications, and to connect with well-known practitioners, executives, VCs and founders in the field. Selected sessions Several sessions at the conference are of particular interest, and some are remotely accessible. The following is just my personal selection: HPC for AI and for science Quantum day Generative AI Data Science Conversational AI Most sessions can also be attended online. They range from beginners to advanced. In total, there are over 900 talks and panels, 300+ exhibitors providing hands-on tech demos, attendee lounges / evening receptions, dinner with stranger events, the NVIDIA gear store, NVIDIA demos, and more. In sunny San Jose, with great food and great people! Personal offer In addition to these benefits, you are welcome to meet with me at the conference.

Learning TracksAll Courses Bundle Hi Alexander, Many options traders are familiar with volatility skew, yet it often remains a puzzle. However, approaching it from a delta neutral angle can help you see the market in a way that brings subtle shifts into focus. The Advanced Options Volatility Trading: Strategies and Risk Management course on Quantra explores advanced options volatility concepts with practical applications with a special focus on risk management. VIEW COURSE → But what is delta neutral volatility skew, and how can you create a trading strategy around it? In today’s classroom, we’ll break down the concept of delta neutral volatility skew, explore how this approach works, and provide practical insights on how you can incorporate it into your trading strategy. Note that backtesting results do not guarantee future performance. The presented results are intended solely for educational purposes and should not be interpreted as investment advice. All the concepts covered in this email are taken from the Quantra course Advanced Options Volatility Trading: Strategies and Risk Management. You can preview the concepts taught in this classroom by clicking on the free preview button and going to Section 10 and Unit 6 of the course. Note: The links in this tutorial will be accessible only after logging into quantra.quantinsti.com In this Quantra Classroom, we will cover the following topics: What is volatility skew? Why does volatility skew exist? Why use the delta neutral approach for calculating the skew? How to calculate delta neutral volatility skew? How to trade based on the delta neutral skew values? If you are new to Options trading, theOptions Trading Strategies In Python: Intermediatecourse would be helpful. Complexity level: Intermediate Author: Akshay Choudhary What is volatility skew? Volatility skew refers to the difference in implied volatility (IV) between options with different strike prices but the same expiration date. Typically, options with strike prices below the current market price (puts) tend to have higher IVs than those above it (calls). This difference creates a skew, which can be graphically represented by plotting the IV against the strike prices. Figure: IV Surface The resulting curve often slopes downward for equities because out-of-the-money (OTM) puts are more expensive than OTM calls. This is due to the higher demand for downside protection. Why does volatility skew exist? Volatility skew exists due to the market’s perception of risk and demand for options. Different factors, such as investor sentiment, demand for hedging, and historical price behaviour, contribute to this skew. For instance, in equity markets, investors often seek protection against significant downside moves, leading to higher demand for put options. This demand increases the IV for puts compared to calls, creating a skew. Also, the market’s belief that sharp price drops are more likely than sharp price rises contributes to the skew. Economic events, earnings announcements, and market volatility are some other factors that influence the skew. There are various methods to quantify this skew. Let us explore one of these methods - delta neutral skew calculation. Why use the delta neutral approach for calculating the skew? A delta neutral volatility skew involves maintaining a portfolio where the net delta—representing the sensitivity of the portfolio’s value to small changes in the underlying asset’s price—is neutral or close to zero while focusing on the volatility skew. By balancing the net delta, the trader’s position is less sensitive to directional market moves, making it a volatility play rather than a directional bet. In other words, the traders can identify opportunities where the market may be overestimating or underestimating volatility at certain strikes, regardless of whether the underlying asset is moving up or down. Now the next question that would come to your mind would be–which delta value should be taken for calculating the skew. Although you can take any value of your choice, there is a study that suggest using 0.25 delta as it is neither too high nor too low for calculating the volatility skew. How to calculate delta neutral volatility skew? The formula for calculating the skew values is: where, Put IV is the IV of the put option with a delta value of -0.25 Call IV is the IV of the call option with a delta value of 0.25 ATM IV is the average IV of the ATM call and put options Note: We have taken the values 0.25 and -0.25 for illustration purposes only. You can modify this as per your preferences. How to trade based on the delta neutral skew values? One way to trade the volatility skew can be using a contrarian approach. If the skew is positive, it means that the put IV premium is greater than the call IV premium, indicating a higher demand for downside protection compared to upside speculation. However, generally the market's perception of risk is exaggerated or skewed, presenting an opportunity to trade as volatility levels adjust. Hence, we will take a long position when the skew crosses above the threshold of 10%. As the put IV usually tends to be higher than the call IV we do not find many instances where the call IV is greater than the put IV hence the skew threshold for going short is taken as -5%. These threshold values are taken for illustration purposes only and can be changed as per your preferences. Long Entry and Exit Signals: Entry Condition: A long position in the underlying asset is opened when the value of volatility skew is greater than 10%. The long position is held as long as the value of volatility skew is greater than 10%. Exit Condition: The long position is closed when the value of volatility skew is less than or equal to 10%. Short Entry and Exit Signals: Entry Condition: A short position in the underlying asset is opened when the value of volatility skew is less than -5%. The short position is held as long as the value of volatility skew is less than -5%. Exit Condition: The short position is closed when the value of volatility skew is greater than or equal to -5%.

Notably, he doesn\\'t seem to believe the Covid vaccine saved lives ( hesitancy has risen ( in the U.S. over the last few years. Belief in vaccine safety fell from 77% in 2021 to 71% in 2023\\u200a-\\u200anot a giant drop, but a statistically significant one. It\\'s not without precedent: The term \"anti-vax\" was coined in 1800 ( four years after the smallpox vaccine severely reduced rates of transmission.A vaccine comes out and successfully protects people against a disease. At the same time, people distrust it. You\\'d expect these trends to be inversely correlated, but they\\'re not.On Medium, epidemiologist Gideon M-K ( theorizes ( \"The problem is that vaccines have become a victim of their own success.\" The once-deadly diseases these vaccines were created to prevent\\u200a-\\u200ameasles, mumps, rubella\\u200a-\\u200ahave now been (almost ( eradicated. The result? A society that forgets how bad those diseases were, and that questions the purpose of vaccines.\"People have no idea what a major measles epidemic looks like,\" M-K explains, \"so the idea that vaccines are dangerous is much easier to believe than it was in the 1980s.\"I\\'m not sure how that logic applies to the Covid vaccine, though. Didn\\'t we all just live through a pandemic? An NIH study namechecks all the typical causes ( of Covid vaccine skepticism: distrust in government, pharma, and institutions\\u200a-\\u200aregardless of the fact that Covid vaccines prove effective in clinical trials and in the real world ( As we get further from the pandemic, though, and if M-K\\'s theory proves correct, skepticism will probably increase. This is the story of all preventive medicine ( We don\\'t invest in it because it doesn\\'t feel important… until it does (and by then it\\'s too late).-Harris Sockel💬 We\\'re also reading…Ramadan begins tonight.

       "  'body': 'View image: ( View image: ( image link: ( Welcome, humans. Looks like we [spoke too soon]( about the [AI crash]( yesterday, huh? Missed calling it by ~two hours. _TL;DR—lots of bumpy economic news, NVIDIA _[_no longer impresses_]( and GPT-4.5’s _[_“mid” release_]( sorta put a dent in the scale hypothesis. More on that below. _**Last Call:** We\\'ve teamed up with our pals at [DZone]( on that [GenAI survey]( today is your final chance to get it done before it closes! It\\'ll take less than 10 minutes, promise. _Seriously, we timed ourselves filling it out and still had time left to wonder if GPT-4.5\\'s price tag will require a second mortgage or just a car loan—you’ll get that joke in a sec._**What\\'s in it for you?** Early access to their trend report data (_perfect for impressing your boss with industry insights_), a free [Getting Started with Agentic AI]( ref card, and a chance to win one of **two $125 gift cards**.[Check it out here]( before close of business today—think of all the things you could buy with that gift card: _a fancy mechanical keyboard, 25 cups of overpriced coffee, or approximately 4 minutes of GPT-4.5 compute time! _**Here’s what you need to know about AI today:*** OpenAI released GPT 4.5 to mixed reactions. * Meta planned a standalone AI app.* IBM released an AI family for enterprises.* Meta unveiled the Aria Gen 2 research glasses. Advertise in The Neuron here. ( image: ( # Was GPT-4.5 so “mid” that it crashed the stock market?View image: ( Yesterday, OpenAI released [GPT-4.5]( “largest and most knowledgeable model yet”, prioritizing _emotional intelligence_ over raw reasoning power ([Pro only]( atm). You knew things were gonna be rough when OpenAI positioned this release _[more about “vibes”]( than anything else. AI researcher Gary Marcus, who constantly criticizes the current AI hype train, called it a “[nothing burger release]( The truth is… _somewhat in the middle? Very fitting, for a model called “4.5”…_**First, ****the vibe take…*** Sam Altman [called GPT-4.5]( “the first model that feels like talking to a thoughtful person.”* Ben Hylak [declared]( it “the _midjourney-moment for writing._”* Dan Shipper (Every) [finds it]( “more extroverted and less neurotic,” but still prone to hallucinations.* Ethan Mollick[ notes]( it “can write beautifully” but gets “oddly lazy on complex projects.\"And several testers noted it will confidently share opinions rather than deflecting with _“As an AI...”_ responses.**Now, the “nothing burger” take…*** Sam also [acknowledged]( it\\'s “a giant, expensive model” that “won\\'t crush benchmarks.”* Former OpenAI researcher Andrej Karpathy [explained it required]( 10X more compute for “diffuse” improvements.* Gary Marcus calls it [evidence]( that “scaling data and compute is not a physical law.”The biggest issue against GPT-4.5? The [pricing is prohibitive]( and $150/output per million tokens (that’s _~10-25X more than competitors_). As one observer perfectly [summed up]( “_Half the TL saying it\\'s bad and too expensive. Half the TL saying it\\'s good and too expensive._”**In fact, GPT-4.5 perfectly encapsulates the AI industry\\'s current dilemma:** incredible technological achievements that can\\'t yet justify their astronomical costs.See, GPT-4.5 is the first major reality check in the [AI scaling race]( and GPT-4.5\\'s marginal improvements suggest we\\'re hitting fundamental limits. Andrej Karpathy [explained]( it well: “_everything is a little bit better and it\\'s awesome”_, but in ways that are hard to notice—slightly better word choice, marginally improved understanding, reduced hallucinations—but nothing revolutionary. **Meanwhile, the economics are brutal:** It cost approximately ~$500M to train GPT-4.5, and OpenAI plans to [burn a lot more than that]( in 2025. Sam also says the company is “[out of GPUs]( Hence, [Stargate]( While all the new chips and servers will remain valuable for running ChatGPT, a model like GPT-4.5 simply can\\'t achieve mass adoption if its economics don\\'t work at scale. **Our take:** Call us conspiratorial, but we don’t think it’s a coincidence that [NVIDIA stock sold off]( right around the time GPT-4.5 was released… The question isn\\'t whether GPT-4.5 offers [better vibes or not]( whether _any amount of vibes_ can justify burning billions on models most people will never use (_and by “models”, we mean you, GPT-4.5_). For OpenAI, this ‘_tweener_ release buys time while they search for a [more sustainable approach]( to pay for new GPUs._ _Why else put out such a _womp womp model?_For investors, [yesterday’s market reaction]( was about uncertainty. And the truth is, nobody knows what happens next with AI. Sam doesn’t know. NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang doesn’t know. And Wall Street CERTAINLY doesn’t know. The only thing everybody DOES know is that the days of blank-check AI funding are numbered.

Cofounded by Stanford student and professor of pediatrics.123Brush is a groundbreaking startup that’s turning the mundane task of brushing teeth into an engaging, AI-powered experience for kids and families. By combining smart toothbrushes, interactive games, and personalized coaching, 123Brush is tackling a universal parenting challenge: getting kids to brush their teeth consistently. The stakes are high—dental caries affect one in two children, leading to costly procedures and lifelong habits. But 123Brush flips the script by making brushing fun. Imagine a four-year-old with a “magic talking toothbrush” that tells stories, asks for input, and even leaves cliffhangers that can only be resolved by brushing for two minutes. It’s not just a product; it’s a behavior-changing ecosystem.The company’s subscription model ensures accessibility, offering brush refills, toothpaste, and even plaque-finding tablets alongside software updates. With a $1.8 billion market for younger kids alone and expansion potential into older children, adults, and even pet care, 123Brush is poised to scale rapidly. Backed by a team with deep expertise in pediatric dentistry, AI, and consumer marketing, including a former Colgate CMO, the startup is already making waves, with plans to debut at CES and SmileCon. By blending entertainment, education, and health, 123Brush isn’t just selling toothbrushes—it’s building a future where dental care is as enjoyable as it is essential.Pitch Video...Unsubscribe \",\n",

Dear Cal alums, parents, and friends,Yue Clare Lou ’18, Ph.D. ’23 never thought about being a scientist as a kid. She was interested in performance instead. But chronic stomach issues — and her mother’s homemade medicinal concoctions — made her curious about the connection between food and health, she said in a 2023 interview with UC Berkeley’s Innovative Genomics Institute.Today Lou is one of 20 students, faculty, and alums recognized for their achievements on this year’s Forbes’ 30 Under 30 list . The list highlights rising stars in 20 categories. Lou, who won in the healthcare category, cofounded Sift Biosciences, a startup spun off of her graduate research on the human microbiome that uses AI and high-throughput screening to create immune boosters for conditions ranging from cancer to autoimmunity. Other alum recipients noted for their inventiveness include Arman Jaffer ’17, whose tool uses AI to help educators generate lesson plans and pop quizzes; Sonia Yang ’17, whose company is setting up sites that enable brand retailers to sell pre-owned clothing to customers and thus reduce waste; and Adam Uliana Ph.D. ’22, whose startup is inventing new systems for recovering minerals from wastes, such as platinum from spent catalytic converters. Also being recognized this week are two alums who have made outstanding contributions to our students. The Grimes Engineering Center , the campus’s newest building opening this spring, is named after Michael ’87 and Janelle ’86 Grimes. Overlooking Memorial Glade, it is first a home where students will engage in expanded opportunities for collaboration and innovation. It will also host advising, tutoring, and career services, as well as academic and social events, for the engineering community and beyond.I was dean of the Haas School of Business when the couple cofounded the Management, Entrepreneurship, & Technology (M.E.T.) Program, a dual-degree program between Haas and the College of Engineering. I recall the active role Michael played in turning the idea for the pairing into a thriving program that now has more than 400 students and alums. It’s fitting that a building dedicated to student success would be named after Michael and Janelle, and I’m honored to celebrate their contributions with the naming.With all that is happening in the world, it’s imperative that we keep telling stories about our university’s remarkable contributions to society and celebrating the wins and points of pride, not the least of which is counting you among our dedicated Cal family.Go Bears!Chancellor Rich Lyons Chancellor’s Choice Event: Texts You Can Taste — Join Dr. Helene Jawhara Piner for a lecture, cooking demo, and tasting of traditional Sephardic foods. Hear how food tells stories about the Jewish Diaspora and learn about Dr. Jawhara Piner’s research, including recipes she has collected from medieval cookbooks, Inquisition trials, and medical treatises. Purchase tickets for the event on Thursday, March 6 at 5:30 p.m. at the Magnes Collection of Jewish Art and Life. Event: Our Unshakeable Fascination with Cults — Join California magazine’s editor Pat Joseph in conversation with Poulomi Saha, associate professor of English, about the exploding interest in cults. Saha is writing a book, Enthralled, about America’s long obsession with “communities and philosophies that offer total belief and total enthrallment — even and especially as we might claim that we would never ourselves join.” Purchase tickets for the event on Thursday, March 27 at 6:30 p.m. at BAMPFA.

In a competitive job market, small differences between applicants can make or break an application, and investing in some hands-on Python skills is one of the most common recommendations we see in data science career guides. If you\\'ve already mastered the basics and would like to branch out into more challenging topics, read on to explore this week\\'s highlights. From data engineering to machine learning workflows, you\\'ll get a taste of the increasingly broad range of use cases that call for Python knowledge, and — we hope — find inspiration to build something neat on your own.

       "  'body': ' Dear MoveOn member, Under the cover of darkness Tuesday night, the Republican-led House of Representatives voted to take away health care, food assistance, and even child care and preschool education from their constituents to fund their tax cuts for the rich.^1 The House passed a budget reconciliation bill that would give $4.5 trillion in tax cuts to corporations and billionaires like Elon Musk.^2 To pay for it, the bill orders $2 trillion in cuts from programs like Medicaid, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and Head Start.^3 We are now a giant step closer to making Musk\\'s drastic DOGE cuts the law of the land, and it\\'s up to the Senate to put a stop to this travesty. If we are going to stop the decimation of support for millions of people, we have to pull out all the stops to make sure Republicans hear loudly from their constituents and MoveOn members like you about how unpopular this bill is. [ ]Trump and his MAGA Congress are trying to rush through a budget that betrays working families and will harm us in a multitude of ways, while deepening income inequality, which is already at a breaking point in our country. We need to sound the alarm LOUDLY and QUICKLY. Will you donate $9 to MoveOn to help stop Republicans from passing these massive tax cuts for the ultra-wealthy?If you\\'ve saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately. Speaker Johnson is trying to sell the American public on the idea that MAGA Is simply ridding the government of \"fraud\" and \"waste.\"^4 It\\'s BS, plain and simple. $2 trillion is more than one-third of all government spending.^5 The $1.1 trillion MAGA wants to hand to billionaires in the first year is the equivalent of all Medicaid and SNAP funding.^6 There is just no way to cut $2 trillion from government spending (especially as the Republican bill increases border security and military funding) without program-ending cuts to health care, green energy, and education. So while 72 million people rely on Medicaid for health care, Trump and Speaker Johnson are trying to cut our entire social safety net to give money back to people making more than $743,000 a year.^7 [ ]Will you pitch in $9 to shut down this horrifying budget bill?If you\\'ve saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately. However, there is a silver lining in the middle of this dumpster fire. The cuts that MAGA is proposing are deeply unpopular. Almost three-quarters of voters oppose Medicaid cuts, and the vast majority want more spending on education and Social Security.^8,9 The more people hear of this bill, the more they\\'ll fight it—and Speaker Johnson managed to pass his bill by only one vote.^10 Every Democrat voted against it, including one who carried her 1-month-old infant onto the floor to vote! We can make this bill so unpopular in the Senate that even Republicans won\\'t touch it. We need to make sure as many voices as possible are raised to stop Trump\\'s tax cuts for the wealthy at our expense. That work includes MoveOn\\'s undertaking a massive effort to move our digital tools—including the system we use to send you emails like this—to platforms that are aligned with the progressive movement. All while we are also running a full-court press to protect our communities by stopping Trump\\'s chaos, as he further enriches these same billionaires. [ ]We need you with us today. Will you donate $9?If you\\'ve saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately.

Pull stats from your Amazon history (“you\\'ve read 17 books this year”).2. Alert you when Taylor Swift tickets drop.3. Recommend the perfect pizza spot based on your preferences and place an order (watch out, [_Operator_]( See and respond to what\\'s happening through its live feed camera.The integration with Amazon\\'s device ecosystem is where things get interesting. **Alexa+ works seamlessly with:*** Echo speakers and displays (including the new Echo Show with its “For You” panel).* Ring security cameras (summarizing footage or highlighting specific moments).* Fire TV (skipping to specific scenes in shows).* Smart home devices across your network.* Amazon Music and other services.But Amazon isn\\'t just targeting your home life. Alexa+ wants to be your _work assistant_, too. Upload documents, emails, and files, and Alexa+ will analyze them to answer questions or create calendar entries and reminders directly from your content.**What makes this particularly clever is that Alexa+ is **[_**model-agnostic**_]( uses both [Amazon\\'s Nova]( and Anthropic\\'s [Claude models]( selecting the best AI for any specific task. This “experts” system (Amazon claims it will eventually have “tens of thousands” of them) mirrors the agent approach that many AI companies are pursuing, and it’s how A+ can interface with all those other devices and services.So how much will all this set you back?** **Free for Prime members (_of course)_ or $19.99/month. A+ officially rolls out in the US over the next few weeks via an early access period.**Our take:** The focus on completing actual tasks rather than just answering questions is smart—it taps into Amazon\\'s [gigantic ecosystem]( of services and devices in a way competitors like ChatGPT and Claude can\\'t match.Amazon says Alexa+ has “deep knowledge” and can answer both specific questions and vague ones—yeah, we’ll need to see how well that works in practice. The new Siri made [similar promises]( and so far, that [hasn’t panned out]( **Also, A+ represents the ultimate AI privacy paradox.** To be genuinely helpful, it needs unprecedented access to your Amazon history, emails, documents, home cameras, and more. This could normalize a level of AI access that other companies have been hesitant to request (and consumers have been unwilling to give).

But no one ever explained how.Was I supposed to cold-call strangers, show up at awkward events, and collect business cards? No thanks!Luckily, networking is so much easier now because of LinkedIn. And for job seekers in 2025, being on LinkedIn isn’t optional—it’s essential.If you haven’t already, get on LinkedIn and start connecting with people in your field. Aim for 500+ connections.Remember, LinkedIn limits how many messages you can send to people you’re not connected with. But once you’re connected, you can message them as much as you want.And fair or not, profiles with fewer than 500 connections can look... well, unserious.So start building your network and getting involved on LinkedIn.

       "  'body': 'View this post on the web at on iTunes [ ], Spotify [ ], or YouTube [ ]If you like reading or listening to this podcast, feel free to click the ❤️ or 🔄 button on this post so more people can discover it on Substack 🙏\"If I\\'ve learned one thing from mindfulness practice, it\\'s that I always have some semblance of controlling how I relate to my experience, whatever that experience might be. So as much as this technology is coming from our systems, it\\'s also attracting us based on our desires and our emotional needs.\" (09:11 in this cast)Jay Vidyarthi [ ] is a designer, mindfulness teacher, and author of the new book Reclaim Your Mind: Seven Strategies To Enjoy Tech Mindfully [ ]. With expertise spanning both thousands of hours in deep meditation practices and helping design over 50 companies in the mindfulness space (i.e. the Muse [ ] headband), Jay offers a uniquely balanced perspective on breaking free from digital addiction without rejecting technology altogether.In this conversation, he reveals how we can reclaim our minds from the attention economy without going off-grid. If you\\'ve ever felt outgunned by social media algorithms or caught in compulsive tech habits, this episode offers a refreshing middle path.This episode is great for:People who feel addicted to technology, social media, or news consumptionParents concerned about their own tech habits and their children\\'sProfessionals experiencing notification fatigue or digital burnoutMeditation practitioners who struggle to reconcile spiritual practice with digital lifeAnyone who\\'s tried quitting tech cold turkey only to slide back into old patternsIdeas that really stuck out to me:Technology addiction is fueled by our unmet emotional needs. Jay describes noticing how his relationship with video games had become unhealthy not because games are inherently bad, but because he was using them compulsively to escape real-life frustrations. Recognizing what emotional needs we\\'re trying to satisfy through technology is the first step toward freedom.We\\'re not as powerless as we think in the attention economy. While billions are spent to manipulate our attention, Jay emphasizes that we always retain some degree of choice. The moment we become aware of our unconscious patterns with technology, they begin to lose their grip on us.Digital interactions often provide illusions rather than what they promise. A dating app \"match\" isn\\'t genuine acceptance. It means someone looked at your photo for half a second. A \"like\" doesn\\'t mean someone really connected with your content. When we recognize these interface metaphors for what they are, we can stop mistaking shallow digital feedback for deep connection.Manufactured \"false urgency\" is the biggest driver of tech addiction. The constant sense that everything needs immediate attention is not true. Whether it\\'s a Slack notification, breaking news, or social media update we tend to relate to these aspects of technology in a way that creates an addictive stress cycle. Recognizing which matters truly require urgency is incredibly liberating.Breaking free doesn\\'t require monk-like discipline. Jay tried being \"studiously mindful\" with all his tech use and found it impossible and joyless. Instead, he suggests occasional moments of insight about our patterns can naturally shift our relationship with technology over time without constant vigilance.Our tech triggers can become gateways for healing. When I notice myself compulsively checking if people liked my posts in group chats, it reveals deeper insecurities about acceptance. Each tech-induced emotional reaction becomes an opportunity to understand and heal these underlying patterns.We need wisdom-seekers involved in creating technology. If everyone concerned with consciousness abandons technology, we leave its development entirely to those motivated by other values. The path forward isn\\'t rejection of technology but transformation of our relationship with it. This includes both as users and creators.What I find most refreshing about Jay\\'s approach is that he doesn\\'t vilify technology or make us feel guilty about our tech habits. Instead, he offers a path of liberation through awareness and compassion. These same principles work for other forms of addiction.His message that \"awareness naturally changes behavior\" resonates deeply.

       "  'body': ' Dear MoveOn member, Donald Trump says he wants the Department of Education to be \"closed immediately.\"^1 In this country, 90% of students go to public school. This is a direct attack on the future of millions of American students and teachers, the right to public education, and the freedom to learn. And despite the fact that Trump knows he needs Congress\\'s buy-in to shutter the Department of Education entirely, he\\'s already made moves to hamstring the important work the department does for students, teachers, and schools across the country.^2 His DOGE henchman, Elon Musk, has cut $900 billion from the program that tracks student learning, and the administration went on a firing spree in the department.^3,4 Trump has instructed his secretary of education pick, Linda McMahon, to \"put herself out of a job\" by dismantling the agency.^5 Whether he has Congress on board or not, Trump\\'s destruction of public education in this country has begun. And if we don\\'t fight back now, millions of students, educators, and families will pay the price. [ ]Please, if you can afford it, will you chip in $9 to help support our emergency campaign to stop Trump\\'s attack on our public schools?If you\\'ve saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately. One of Trump\\'s aces in his war against the Department of Education is that many Americans are not aware of what the agency\\'s purview is. People think that the Department of Education controls a large swath of school funding and directs the curriculum our students are learning.^6 But nothing could be further from the truth. There are actually laws against having a national curriculum, and the Department of Education provides only a small—but essential—fraction of total school funding.^7 What the Department of Education really does is help students from all backgrounds access a sound education, no matter where they live, their learning abilities, their native language(s), or their race. Here\\'s just a small insight into what the Department of Education does—and what would disappear if Trump gets his way: 1.Does your child have a disability? From autism to ADHD to blindness, children with disabilities are entitled to educational supports and services through Individualized Education Programs—the law for which is overseen by the Department of Education.^8 No Department of Education means no agency for parents to appeal to for those services. 2.Do you need help affording college? The Department of Education administers student loans and other aid for 42 million Americans.^9 Shifting student loans to private industry would practically guarantee that many people would lose access. 3.Do you know a girl who is amazing in science class? Title IX, administered by the Department of Education, makes sure that her teachers give her the same opportunities as her male classmates, whether it\\'s in biology lab or on the sports field.^10 4.Do you live near a Title I school? Title I is the Department of Education program that provides critical additional funding to schools in high-poverty areas. Approximately 180,000 teachers could lose their jobs and free school lunch could end for those schools without the Department of Education.^11 MoveOn is launching an emergency campaign to educate the public about the crucial role of the Department of Education and demand that lawmakers step in to stop this travesty. We stopped Trump\\'s attacks on education during his first term. We can do it again—but only with your support. [ ]The future of American education is at stake. Together, we can protect it. Will you donate $9 now to help save the Department of Education?If you\\'ve saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately.

He\\'s an asteroid, and as Neil DeGrasse Tyson tweeted on Valentine\\'s Day, for a brief period there was a 2% ( chance that he would hit Earth sometime within the next decade. 2024 YR4 is a pretty big boy (slightly larger than a football field) and he\\'s a level 3 on the Torino scale ( meaning he\\'s got a 1% or greater probability of causing \"localized destruction\" (essentially, destroying a city ( His reign of terror would begin in December 2032.Briefly, last week, the chance of impact rose to as high as 3.1%\\u200a-\\u200acausing… not panic exactly, but consternation ( The chance of impact has since been brought down to 0.28% ( Medium, astronomy researcher Rebecca Jean T. ( breaks down how we got from 3.1% to nearly zero ( Essentially, as any object approaches Earth, our images of its path become more accurate. \"It is important to keep in mind that high-quality observations could take several years,\" she writes, \"as the best data is collected when it is nearby\"\\u200a-\\u200aand it won\\'t be nearby until 2028. Even if it does hit Earth, the chances of it hurting us are small. 71% of Earth\\'s surface is water. Given a 0.28% chance of impact, and \"an even smaller chance that it hits somewhere populated, it is nearly impossible for it to crash somewhere that wipes out an entire city,\" she explains.For comparison, the last time a celestial object hit Earth and caused significant damage was in 2013, when a ball of iron exploded over Russia ( and around 112 people were hospitalized for either flash blindness or injuries from broken glass. The meteor went totally undetected until it struck because it was flying in front of the sun, so we couldn\\'t see it. (NASA\\'s near-Earth detection systems have improved since then ( interestingly, there\\'s another near-Earth asteroid hovering out there: Apophis, named for the ancient Egyptian god of chaos. You can think of Apophis like 2024 YR4\\'s bigger, even more chaotic brother (about twice as big as the Eiffel Tower). Apophis won\\'t hit us, but it will whiz past Earth on April 13, 2029 (Friday the 13th!), missing us by only ~19,000 miles and coming 10 times closer to us than the moon ( It will look like a very bright shooting star whipping through the sky. You\\'ll be able to see it from Africa and Europe ( safe out there!- Harris Sockel🌎 Elsewhere on the internet…Desirée Stephens draws a connection between systems of mutual aid among Black communities in the U.S. 200 years ago and West African rotating savings and credit systems ( The concept of mutual aid (\\u200a-\\u200aan organizing principle that essentially means \"giving what you can and getting what you need\"\\u200a-\\u200adates back to medieval craft guilds, and was a founding principle of the Free African Society, one of the first Black-led institutions in the U.S. dedicated to helping newly freed, formerly enslaved people build community, skills, and wealth.A definition of humility: coming to terms with the fact that \"what was once widely accepted truth is now outdated dogma and it will be again ( (Andrew Bosworth)Political organizing is no substitute for therapy ( (Clementine Morrigan)This musical rendition of rage-baiting ( made me laugh… a lot.

       "  'body': 'Leaving the company you founded + writing about your obsessions (Issue #277)The Medium Newsletter ( newsletter byThe Medium Blog ( 27, 2025∙2 min read∙View on Medium ( is usually just incuriosityLeaving the company you founded + writing about your obsessions (Issue #277)\"The reality of a technical position,\" writes ( systems administrator Cooper Lund ( \"is that most of what you do isn\\'t what people think counts as technical work like writing code\\u200a-\\u200athe majority of the work is being an investigator and a thinker.\"Essentially, his job is to be curious.It\\'s true of most \"knowledge work\": the job itself is primarily about how you solve problems ( and arriving at a solution often comes from deep, relentless curiosity. \"The older I get,\" Lund writes, \"the more I understand that there aren\\'t a lot of people who are stupid, but there are a lot of people who are incurious.\" He refers to a story by Amy Schneider ( (who won 40 consecutive Jeopardy! games) as a prime example of how curiosity can enrich your life. It would be easy to dismiss Schneider as someone who simply memorized a bunch of trivia, but as she puts it:…not only have I acquired the (fairly useless) knowledge of the definition of oviparous, I\\'ve gained greater insight into how our society organizes itself, and the motivations (and thus implicit biases) that drive scientists…When you seek out the answer to anything\\u200a-\\u200aeven something as obscure as the definition of oviparous (a term to describe birds that hatch eggs)\\u200a-\\u200ayou\\'ll come across contextual information that reveals how the world works.Lund thinks AI could threaten our curiosity by giving us easier, ready-made answers (he calls it an \"incuriosity engine\"). But that doesn\\'t have to happen! It\\'s up to each of us to safeguard our curiosity, and to keep questioning the responses we get from anyone or anything, human or bot. For a primer on stoking your own curiosity, I recommend this story ( from Clive Thompson ( It describes a process he calls \"rewilding your attention\"-essentially, expanding your info sources so you have \"wilder, curiouser thoughts.\" One tip: diversify your search engines! Thompson recommends a few weirder search tools than Google or ChatGPT, like Marginalia Search ( an \"independent DIY search engine that focuses on non-commercial content.\"-Harris Sockel💼 Also today…Ash Jurberg ( describes how it feels to leave the company you founded and watch it grow without you: \"The statistics say 80% of business partnerships end in divorce\\u200a-\\u200adouble the rate of marriages\\u200a-\\u200ayet we\\'re somehow always surprised when it happens to us ( and podcaster Leah Nicole Whitcomb ( wants to read more stories by Black people that aren\\'t primarily about white supremacy ( real purpose: focing us all to Try Harder ( (Thomas Ricouard ( A dose of practical wisdom: On writing\"Writing isn\\'t about following a trend.

After the devastating break-in at our store, we were met with something truly remarkable—an outpouring of love and support from all of you. Your kindness lifted us up in a time of need, and we are beyond grateful.As a small way to pay it forward, we’re offering a special gift: Backyard Birds: Tips & Tricks, a 5-week online photography course, completely free. Led by Jen Waicukauski, this live Zoom series has been celebrated by past students. We’ll explore not just photographing our avian neighbors, but also how we can notice the natural wonders in our local spaces and begin to understand the world from the birds perspective. We will discuss habits and habitats to learn how we can make space for more birds in our lives and our yards. We’ll cover how to be photo-ready for the moments our winged friends arrive, quick to get our images and be respectful of both the birds and our bodies (long lenses are heavy and learning how to move with them so they are more asset than burden is all part of enjoying our craft for as long as we can).So if watching birds, making art and connecting with nature sounds good to you, join us. We believe it is great for our mental health and an excellent method of combating anxiety and depression, during challenging times like these.No worries if you can’t make each of the five sessions, we’ll record each one so you can “rewind” it for 30-days after the session takes place.When: Five Saturdays—April 5, 12, 19, 26 & May 3Time: 9:00 AM (90-minute sessions)Where: Live on Zoom (recordings available)Cost: Normally $249—now FREE, as a thank you!Photography has always been about connection—both to the world around us and to one another. We hope this class brings you as much joy as your support has brought us.With gratitude,The Looking Glass Photo TeamLearn More & RSVP ( (C) 2025 Looking Glass Photo.

       "  'body': ' [ ]Sign the petition: Stop the erasure of trans history at Stonewall! Dear fellow MoveOn member, Trump\\'s administration is trying to erase trans people. The National Park Service (NPS) recently removed all references to transgender and queer people from its website for Stonewall National Monument—a landmark that exists because of the LGBTQ+ rights movement. This blatant act of erasure stems from Trump\\'s executive orders targeting the trans community.^1 I joined members of the queer community outside Stonewall in New York City to protest this injustice. The trans and drag community have always been part of the LGBTQ+ community, and we refuse to let their story be erased. [ ]Will you sign my petition calling on the National Park Service to do everything in its power to stop this erasure and restore trans history to the Stonewall National Monument website? The Stonewall Inn isn\\'t just a bar—it\\'s a deeply integral part of queer history. In 1969, it became the battleground for LGBTQ+ liberation when a police raid sparked protests led by trans women, drag queens, and queer people of color. Activists like Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera—two trans women of color—were at the forefront, risking everything to demand safety and equality.^2 In 2016, Stonewall became the first national monument in the country dedicated to LGBTQ+ history in a big step toward recognizing the resilience of our community. Now, Trump\\'s administration is trying to rewrite history by erasing trans people from it. [ ]We can\\'t allow Trump\\'s crusade against the trans community. Sign my petition now to demand NPS reverse these changes and restore the full history of Stonewall! Stop the erasure of trans history at Stonewall! [4]Sign the petition The MAGA movement to erase LGBTQ+ history isn\\'t just symbolic, it\\'s incredibly dangerous. These actions send a chilling message to trans people that they don\\'t belong, their stories don\\'t matter, and their existence can be quietly scrubbed from the record. The bravery of trans activists like Marsha and Sylvia helped ignite the modern fight for LGBTQ+ rights. Removing all references to transgender people from the Stonewall National Monument is not only a direct attack on their legacy but also on the entire trans community. It may seem like a small change to revise \"LGBTQ\" to \"LGB,\" but it\\'s a reckless one with huge implications. At a time when trans people are already under attack, this move from NPS only emboldens extremists and makes LGBTQ+ folks less safe. And make no mistake, these attacks are never going to stop with just one community. We\\'ve always been loud and clear about campaigns that seek to silence our communities, and it\\'s no different now. [ ]Add your name to demand accountability from NPS and show trans people across the country that they are seen and supported. Thanks for all you do. –Steven M., MoveOn member Sources: 1. \"You can\\'t erase us\\': Community rallies after \\'trans\\' and \\'queer\\' removed from Stonewall Monument website,\" CNN, February 14, 2025 [ ] 2. \"These transgender icons will be the first to get statues in the US,\" CNN, May 31, 2019 [ ] You\\'re receiving this petition because we thought it might interest you.

       "  'body': 'View this post on the web at Lalli Music is the cookbook author, recipe developer, and video host behind Food Processing . She recently shared The True Costs of Being on YouTube [ ], a deep dive into the challenges of being a YouTube creator, from monthly expenses to grueling production schedules. Now, she’s going all-in on her Substack, where she’s built a strong community and a sustainable business. Substack’s Austin Tedesco caught up with Carla to talk about escaping the algorithm, learning to embrace imperfection, and the importance of owning your work. Here are a few highlights from their conversation.On escaping the algorithmCarla Lalli Music: I think early on I was more preoccupied with SEO, with trying to figure out what was gonna do well, and a little bit more attached to—like, if a video did well, I really felt it emotionally. And if a video didn’t, it hit me personally. I got better about that over time because I realized you can’t figure out the algorithm, and you’re gonna screw yourself over trying to. And at that point, I was like, I’m just going to make the videos for the food that I love, that I’m excited to talk about, where there’s a story, there’s learnings, it’s beautiful, or whatever. And that helped a lot.On owning your workCarla: I think the most important thing about being a creator is owning your IP, right? You are executive producing your work, all of it, all the time. And these platforms, much like any other corporation, they’re going to change the algorithm on you. They’re going to introduce shorts. They’re going to be prioritizing reels. They’re going to ding you for trying to link out.Instagram is not friendly to creators, because if you try to promote your work, you’re penalized for it. So take [social] with a grain of salt. Social doesn’t have to be core to your career.On the freedom of live videosCarla: I mean, it’s exciting, the idea of being able to hop on and do a live. And it reminds me of something my producer has been saying from the beginning: “Carla, people just want to watch you cook. Just watching you cook is awesome.” And I have to take that and believe it. And so there is something super-appealing [about live videos].Also, for a live, you set up, you do it, and if you screw up in the middle, honestly, that’s cool.Austin Tedesco: It’s cool, right? I would love to watch you be like, “Oh, I overcooked this component, and now you’re going to watch me fix it.” Because that’s a thing that happens to me when I cook.On creative video strategiesCarla: I’ve had this idea in the past of a cook-along that happens over multiple days.So that’s a good example, the duck confit. To be able to go on, talk about butchering the duck, seasoning the duck, setting it up, and being like “Okay, we’re gonna be back in 48 hours, and we’ll talk about what it looks like and how to put it in the oven.” Do that, show how it changed, setting up the oven, and putting it in. And then being like, “Great, we’ll be back tomorrow to show what it looks like when it’s coming out.” That would be really fun.I would do it as a live that then could be uploaded. So to go back to the duck confit example, we can plan: “Here’s the ingredients you’ll need tonight at 5 p.m. ET. I’m going to cure the duck, so get your duck and meet me there.”But then, because you can save the video and upload it, anybody who missed [it live] can also just follow along in [their own] time.On embracing imperfectionAustin: What do you hope to accomplish in video specifically as you think about this new chapter for you?Carla: In video, I think longevity and sustainability are really important.I’m used to, like, a $4,000 production that’s very polished where, you know, you can see the food, and we work hard on angles, and all that stuff. Being okay with a different format, and how that affects things, and accepting it. And I’m not saying one is better than the other, [but] this is going to be different. The whole setup is going to be different. The mindset is going to be different. And maybe the payoff is going to be different, but being okay with that.This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.Unsubscribe ',\n",

       "  'body': \" Autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation help traders understand the structure and dependencies in price or volume data. Live Webinar Hi Alexander, Ever think about how past market movements might hold clues to what’s coming next? That’s where time series analysis comes in. Two tools that stand out in this space are autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation. The use of these tools is covered along with the Python code in the Quantra course Financial Time Series Analysis for Trading. VIEW COURSE Don’t let the fancy names scare you—they’re super handy for understanding how financial assets behave. Curious to know how they work and why they matter? Let’s break it down together! All the concepts covered in this email are taken from the Quantra course Financial Time Series Analysis for Trading. You can preview certain concepts taught in this classroom by clicking on the free preview button and going to Section 11 and Unit 11 of the course. Note: The links in this tutorial will be accessible only after logging into quantra.quantinsti.com. In this Quantra Classroom, we will cover the following topics: What is Autocorrelation? What is Partial Autocorrelation? Why Do Autocorrelation and Partial Autocorrelation Matter in Trading? How to Analyze Autocorrelation and Partial Autocorrelation? The implementation of the ACF and PACF functions is done using Python; therefore, if you’re new to Python, then you’ll find the course on Python for Trading! quite helpful. Complexity Level: Intermediate Author: Akshay Choudhary What is Autocorrelation? Autocorrelation, or what’s often called lagged correlation, is basically about checking how similar a time series is to its past self. Think of it like asking, “Do past values have any say in what’s happening now?” It’s a way to measure how much the past influences the present, giving you insight into patterns or trends that might still be in play. Formally, autocorrelation at lag k is the correlation between Xt and Xt-k : Where: Cov(Xt,Xt-k): Covariance between Xt and Xt-k. σt, σt-k: Standard deviations of Xt and Xt-k. Autocorrelation works on a scale from -1 to 1, and here’s what that really means: Positive autocorrelation (ρ>0): This is when past values and future values move in the same direction. So, if something was going up before, chances are it’ll keep going up for a bit. Negative autocorrelation (ρ<0): Here, it’s the opposite. If the past values were increasing, the future ones might take a dip, and vice versa. Zero autocorrelation (ρ=0): No connection here—past movements don’t really affect what happens next. To make this easier to understand, traders use something called an Autocorrelation Function (ACF) plot. It’s a chart that shows you the correlation at different time lags, helping you spot patterns or cycles in the data. It’s like having a quick visual summary of how much the past matters! Figure: Autocorrelation of Wheat ETF (2011-2020) Points to note: We do not look at autocorrelation at lag 0 as the current wheat price is perfectly correlated with itself. Values from lag 1 to 10 that lie outside the blue region are statistically significant. The blue region is the confidence interval. The default set confidence interval in the is 95%. It can be interpreted as with 95% confidence level; you can say that from 11 months, the wheat price is not correlated with the current month price. A slow decay of autocorrelation shows that monthly wheat prices are less correlated with the current wheat prices as we move more in the past. What is Partial Autocorrelation? Partial autocorrelation takes things a step further by focusing only on the direct effect of a lag on the current value. It’s like cutting out all the “middlemen” and asking, “What’s the real connection between Xt and Xt-k without any interference from the lags in between?” Here’s an example to make it clear: Autocorrelation at lag 2 measures the relationship between Xt and Xt-2, including any indirect effects via Xt-1. Partial autocorrelation at lag 2 removes the influence of Xt-1, isolating the pure relationship between Xt and Xt-2. The Partial AutoCorrelation Function (PACF) plot is used to visualize partial correlations at various lags. Figure: Partial Autocorrelation of Wheat ETF (2011-2020) Points to note: Partial autocorrelation plot of wheat ETF price has both negative and positive values. For example, at lag 1 it is positive, which means the previous month's price of wheat is positively correlated with current month's price. Similarly, at lag 2 it is negative. It means the prices two months before are negatively correlated with the current month's price. Lag 1, 11, 18, 31, 32, 34 and 38 are statistically significant. Why Do Autocorrelation and Partial Autocorrelation Matter in Trading? Autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation help traders understand the structure and dependencies in price or volume data. These insights are critical for: 1. Forecasting Future Prices Many trading models, like ARIMA or GARCH, assume that past values influence future ones. Autocorrelation helps confirm if your data actually supports this assumption. It’s like checking if the foundation of your strategy is solid. 2. Identifying Market Patterns Traders use autocorrelation to detect seasonal patterns, trends, or mean-reverting behaviour in asset prices. 3. Identifying Market Patterns Partial autocorrelation steps in when you’re building time series models, helping you figure out which lags really matter. It’s about cutting out the noise and focusing on what’s important. 4.Testing Strategy Viability Autocorrelation can reveal if a strategy (e.g., mean reversion) is supported by historical data. How to Analyze Autocorrelation and Partial Autocorrelation? Step 1: Plot the ACF Compute autocorrelation coefficients for various lags. Plot the ACF to visualise significant lags. Step 2: Interpret the ACF Plot Look for significant spikes (outside the confidence interval) to identify meaningful relationships. A gradual decay suggests a long memory process, which is common in trending markets. Step 3: Plot the PACF Compute partial autocorrelation coefficients for various lags. Plot the PACF to isolate significant direct relationships. Step 4: Determine Model Parameters Use the ACF and PACF plots to select the AR and MA terms for your model:- ACF: Guides the order of the MA component.- PACF: Guides the order of the AR component. Tools: Python libraries such as statsmodels and pandas make it easy to compute and plot ACF/PACF. We have covered ACF and PACF in detail along with the Python code in the Financial Time Series Analysis for Trading course.

       "  'body': 'Five-minute piano breaks + opening doors (Issue #276)The Medium Newsletter ( newsletter byThe Medium Blog ( 26, 2025∙3 min read∙View on Medium ( perspectives on 3 years of war in UkraineFive-minute piano breaks + opening doors (Issue #276)Monday marked three years since Russia invaded Ukraine. Russia still occupies 20% of the country ( Every day, more missiles and drones hit Ukrainian infrastructure ( and monuments ( Over 1 million ( people have been killed or injured, and the war shows no signs of stopping\\u200a-\\u200adespite failed attempts to resolve it through UN sanctions ( the headlines, it\\'s easy to lose sight of what the war means on a human level.For that, I want to share two first-person perspectives I found on Medium by Ukrainian writers. First, there\\'s Anton Kutselyk ( who\\'s been writing consistently from Kyiv since 2022. A few weeks ago, he gave us a tour of his city on an extraordinarily sunny day (\\u200a-\\u200ajust a normal slice of life, the kind of quotidian perspective you can\\'t get elsewhere. A few months ago, he published a rundown of some of his favorite new bookstores ( (they\\'re all gorgeous, too) that have popped up in Kyiv.To me, this is very inspiring proof that humans will keep learning, growing, and starting beautiful new businesses, even under trying and uncertain circumstances.The growth of bookstores in Ukraine is also a response, in some ways, to the invasion. Kutselyk writes, \"Cafes in Kyiv still occupy an important place in social life. But since Russia invaded […] people started to gravitate towards something more potent […] Ukrainian culture is finally getting freer and fuller in its expression.\"my new favorite bookstore, Sens, which happens to be in Kyiv (photo by Anton Kutselyk)Anastasia Lebedenko (\\u200a-\\u200aa native Ukrainian who moved back home in 2020 after a few years in Canada\\u200a-\\u200areflects on the grief of war ( \"Acceptance of war means accepting the most horrific sides of human nature,\" she writes. Ukraine tiptoed into war when she was eighteen, during the Donbas conflict (\\u200a-\\u200awhich wasn\\'t called a \"war\" at first, but an \"anti-terrorist operation\" to root out Russian-backed separatists. It never grew as intense as what she\\'s living through now.For some history, I recommend Economist correspondent Noah Sneider ( The Empire Strikes Back ( from the Medium archive. Sneider grew up in Moscow and spent a week in Ukraine during the Donbas war in 2014. His perspective is more nuanced because he has family and friends in both countries, and he reaches back in time to tell the thousand-plus-year history of Russia\\'s relationship with Ukraine, both of which descend from the medieval slavic state Kievan Rus. Each nation interprets its relationship to this shared history differently. Sneider writes: \"Two nations riding fundamentally incompatible historical narratives have crashed. The stakes could not be higher, and not simply because Russia fears NATO expansion, but because Russia fears losing its brother, losing its family, and thus losing itself.\" I highly recommend reading the full story for more on the deep, deep roots of this war.-Harris SockelWhat else we\\'re readingDon\\'t wait to care about something before you start working on it. If you spend enough time, each day, on a project… you will eventually begin caring ( (Rhiannon James ( work for yourself before you work for the company that has hired you (\\u200a-\\u200aCTO Amanda Southworth ( you work from home, there is nothing preventing you from taking five-minute breaks to reset your focus with a few cathartic scales on the piano ( (or whatever your creative outlet of choice might be), as Zach O\\'Leary ( does.✨ A top highlight on Medium last week\"Remember that when one door closes.

       "  'subject': 'Why MSNBC canceled Joy Reid',\n",
       "  'timestamp': '2025-02-25 17:02:00-08',\n",
       "  'body': ' Dear MoveOn member, We should be worried: The news media is in danger under Donald Trump. Look at these recent headlines: \"MSNBC cancels Joy Reid show as part of overhaul under new administration,\" reported The Hill on Sunday.^1 \"Washington Post Cancels Ad From Groups Calling for Trump to Fire Musk,\" The New York Times wrote last week.^2 Reid, a powerful and outspoken critic of Trump, began hosting shows at MSNBC in 2014. Her show, \"The ReidOut,\" has been on air since 2020. Her firing was abrupt. Trump praised MSNBC\\'s move to cancel Reid\\'s show, saying horrific things about her and calling her \"one of the least talented people in television,\" who should have been \"canned\" long ago.^3 The Washington Post\\'s decision to reject the anti-Musk ad comes on the heels of Jeff Bezos, the paper\\'s owner, sitting in the front row at Trump\\'s inauguration and after he demanded that the paper, at the 11th hour, pull its presidential endorsement of Kamala Harris.^4,5 And then earlier today the White House announced they will hand-select the reporters who can ask the president questions at events.^6 In free countries, leaders don\\'t get to choose which reporters cover them. At the same time, Elon Musk has made X into a pro-Trump echo chamber, Meta gutted its moderation and fact-checking on its platforms, and the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress, led by Marjorie Taylor Greene, have launched multiple attacks on public media—NPR and PBS.^7,8 Alexander, we urgently need to both protect public media and use MoveOn\\'s large megaphone to get the truth to millions of Americans about Trump and Musk\\'s reign of destruction and what we can all do about it, together. MoveOn can reach tens of millions of people through email, text messages, and on social media. And in this critical moment, we\\'re significantly modernizing and strengthening our digital infrastructure. But it\\'s a huge undertaking, and we\\'re doing it while also firing on all cylinders to blunt Trump and Musk\\'s attacks on Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, public schools, and more. Can you chip in $5 a month to help MoveOn strengthen our technology infrastructure to be able to reach more people and at lightning speed so we can get the truth out and engage millions of people in the fight for our communities, freedoms, and safety? [ ]Yes, I\\'ll chip in $5 a month. If you\\'ve saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately. [ ]No, I\\'m sorry, I can\\'t make a monthly donation. The latest news about MSNBC and The Washington Post follows Disney, which owns ABC News, paying Trump $15 million to settle a bogus lawsuit, Meta and X writing Trump big checks to settle similar lawsuits, and Paramount Global, owner of CBS News, considering settling a defamation lawsuit with Trump that they almost certainly would win in court.^9 And Trump personally made the decision to bar the Associated Press, one of the most well-respected news organizations in the world, from the White House and Air Force One after the news outlet declined to refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the \"Gulf of America.\"^10 The consolidation of the corporate media and tech billionaires behind Trump and the MAGA movement (remember, in addition to Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, the CEOs of Google and TikTok also flanked Trump at his inauguration) poses a major threat to the future of our country—which is why MoveOn is doing everything we can to fight back.^11 That work includes MoveOn\\'s undertaking a massive effort to move our digital tools—including the system we use to send you emails like this—to platforms that are aligned with the progressive movement. All while we are also running a full-court press to protect our communities by stopping Trump\\'s chaos, as he further enriches these same billionaires. The amount of work involved cannot be overstated, and as a grassroots organization, we are able to do it only with your support, Alexander. Please, if you are able, will you donate $5 a month to ensure that MoveOn has the resources to continue all of our work? [ ]Yes, I\\'ll chip in $5 a month. If you\\'ve saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately. [ ]No, I\\'m sorry, I can\\'t make a monthly donation. MoveOn is migrating much of our digital infrastructure to a platform called ActionNetwork, which was created by a nonprofit organization with deep ties to the labor movement. We have also made the decision to no longer actively post content on X and are working diligently to rebuild our social media presence on Bluesky, an open-source platform with much stronger community controls. In addition, we\\'re investing even more heavily in tech security to help prevent hackers from attempting to infiltrate MoveOn or shut us down through coordinated online attacks. And we\\'re organizing MoveOn\\'s millions of members to hold the corporate media accountable, stop Trump and Republicans in Congress from shutting down NPR and PBS, and fight against abuses by big tech companies and misinformation. Essentially, we need to walk and chew gum at the same time. We have to migrate our data piece by piece while also training volunteers to organize events in their communities. We have to rebuild our digital infrastructure while also flooding Congress with calls. We have to retrain our staff to use entirely new systems while ensuring that MoveOn\\'s millions of members are kept informed and given concrete ways to take action against the Trump administration. It\\'s a lot of work, but we are confident that we have made the right decision and that MoveOn will be stronger, more secure, and better able to lead in the fights to come because of it. We have just over two months left to complete our tech migration process, and we need your help to make sure we cross the finish line. Can you chip in $5 a month to help us through this most challenging of times? [ ]Yes, I\\'ll chip in $5 a month. If you\\'ve saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately. [ ]No, I\\'m sorry, I can\\'t make a monthly donation.

       "  'body': \"Email from BLC It's the universal month of love...well, maybe not for everybody. Cartier, the luxury jewelry powerhouse, recently learned that you can’t trademark “love”—at least not in Singapore. The brand, famous for its “LOVE” bracelet, attempted to block MoneyMax, a pawnbroking chain, from registering the term “Love Gold” for its own jewelry line. Cartier argued that its “LOVE” mark, first made famous by the iconic bracelet featuring a screw motif, was well established and deserved protection. Singapore’s Intellectual Property Office (IPOS) wasn’t buying it and is delivering the kiss off. In their ruling they noted that “love” is too common in the jewelry industry to be monopolized, reinforcing a fundamental truth about trademarks: Common phrases and monikers are not always trademarkable even if you were first to make it famous. The decision serves as a reminder that even billion-dollar brands can’t stake a claim on universal human emotions or common terms in the vernacular zeitgeist. What This Means for Brands “Hooked on a Feeling” Trademarks exist to prevent consumer confusion and protect brand identity and a source of origin. They are not here to protect generic terms such as “love,” “heart,” and “forever” in a descriptive context. And so, as many romantic novels play out Cartier learned that the hard way and ran out of time. That doesn’t mean brands can’t create distinctive (also fanciful) marks around common words. Nike didn’t trademark “run,” but it owns “Just Do It.” Apple doesn’t own “fruit,” but it’s simple bitten apple logo is unmistakable. When trademarks rely too heavily on generic words without unique elements—such as design, font, or stylization—they run the risk of being rejected, diluted, or even canceled – and also not serving the purpose of a trademark. The above is an excerpt from our latest blog published last week shared on the HuskiAI site!

Enthralled: What Explains Our Unshakeable Fascination with Cults? with Poloumi Saha, associate professor of English at UCBerkeley Thursday, March 27, 2025 |6:30 p.m. Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive 2155 Center St, Berkeley, CA 94720GET TICKETS NOW Hi All, Pat Joseph here, editor of California magazine, inviting you to the next California Live! at the Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive, where I’ll be talking to UC Berkeley’s Dr. Poulomi Saha, Ph.D., who teaches the highly in-demand course, “Cults in Popular Culture,” about our collective fascination with cults and what it says about us. Among the questions we’ll probe: What makes a cult a cult, as opposed to an ideology or a religion? Do people join cults or just get swept up by them? If you and I were in a cult, would we even know it? And, perhaps most importantly, is the United States now in thrall to a cult of personality? I’m sure you have your own questions. Bring them to the show on Thursday, March 27, and join the discussion with Dr. Saha at the reception afterward. I promise it will be an interesting evening.

It all dates back to 2007, when Perkins and Obrecht founded Fusion Books, an online platform for students to create their own school yearbooks. In a matter of years they were the biggest suppliers of yearbooks in Australia. Turned out that with accessible, intuitive tools, anyone could dream of making their own creations. This inspired **the launch of Canva in 2013**. The vision was to democratize graphic design for everyone, everywhere. No matter how unfamiliar you were with the field, if you had access to the Internet, you had access to a world of options for flyers, posters, logos and all things graphic design.As of today, Canva has birthed over [30 billion designs]( from more than 190 countries all over the world-that’s 38.5 million designs per day. It’s safe to say graphic design has been democratized indeed. Now, how is it that in just over a decade Canva went from brainstorming in Perkins’ mom’s living room, to a **communication powerhouse worth tens of billions of dollars**?----------———————————————————————————Subscribe to Premium to read the rest.Become a paying subscriber to get access to this post and other subscriber-only content.Upgrade to paid: are reading a plain text version of this post.

       "  'timestamp': '2025-02-24 13:50:30-08',\n",
       "  'body': ' When companies invest in DEI, they invest in people.[ ]89,000 MoveOn members have signed the petition telling Target\\'s leadership to uphold its commitment to DEI. Will you join us? Dear fellow MoveOn member, Target is one of the major corporations disappointingly rolling back diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts in order to align themselves with Trump\\'s hateful agenda. Already, these efforts are harming Target\\'s reputation as a socially conscious leader and leaving Black-owned small businesses confused about what’s on the horizon.^1 The last month has been jarring as Trump continues his crusade against diversity and inclusion. But there are also prominent companies standing their ground—Costco and Apple are defending their DEI programs, and we need Target to join them.^2 Target has a real chance to be a leader in this moment and do what\\'s right. [ ]Tens of thousands of us have already raised our voices to demand that Target bring back its DEI efforts and continue investing in initiatives that support underrepresented communities, minority-owned businesses, and inclusive hiring practices. Will you add your name to join us? Even the daughters of Target co-founder Bruce Dayton have expressed concerns about the direction of the company, stating: \"We are alarmed how quickly the business community has given in to the current administration\\'s retaliatory threats.\"^3 Target marketed itself as a company that celebrated the diversity of its workers, creators, and customers. It\\'s unacceptable for executives to profit off of our communities one minute and then abandon us the next. We deserve better. DEI programs at their core are meant to ensure that businesses like Target are welcoming, fair, and inclusive to the different workers, customers, and public that they interact with. Dayton believed in the \"clear principles of happy customers and strong communities\"—values that Target has now abandoned by choosing to end diversity programs.^4 Equity initiatives transform lives, help companies and communities succeed, and lead to healthier, happier workplaces. It\\'s up to consumers to tell Target we want them to do the right thing—for their business and for us. [ ]Sign the petition and then share this email with 3 friends so we can generate a surge of energy that Target\\'s leadership simply can\\'t ignore. Thanks for all you do. –Garrett N., MoveOn member P.S. Check out my earlier email below for details on the evidence behind these critical programs. Sources: 1. \"Target Went All In on D.E.I.; Its Sudden Pullback Has Black Sellers Reeling,\" The New York Times, February 5, 2025 2. \"Companies like Costco and Apple are defending their DEI programs despite nationwide pushback—These are the companies standing by their policies,\" Fortune, January 29, 2025 3. \"Target cofounder\\'s daughters \\'shocked and dismayed\\' at retailer\\'s DEI rollback,\" Business Insider, February 13, 2025 4. Ibid. -------------------------------------------------------------------------- [ ]Target is rolling back inclusivity programs—sign the petition to tell Target\\'s leadership to uphold its commitment to DEI! Dear fellow MoveOn member, For years, Target has been a leader in corporate responsibility, championing initiatives designed to empower small businesses, increase Black representation in the workforce, and make its customers feel seen. These programs aren\\'t just good for people—they\\'re also good for business. Target was one of the most outspoken supporters of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts. But now, Target leadership is suddenly backtracking on their commitment to these programs. Target\\'s past pledges—like increasing Black workforce representation by 20%, supporting minority-owned suppliers, and donating to social justice causes—have positively impacted countless lives.^5 Donald Trump has been targeting DEI efforts since Day 1 in office, and by caving to his divisive threats, Target is betraying the very customers who have supported its success. [ ]When companies invest in DEI, they invest in people. Now\\'s the time for Target to stand firm in its values, not retreat. Will you add your name to call on Target\\'s leadership to reinstate its DEI programs? Tell Target: Uphold your commitment to inclusion and reinstate DEI programs! [6]Sign the petition In 2020, Target CEO Brian Cornell said George Floyd\\'s murder by police, which took place just 10 minutes from Target\\'s headquarters, had a personal impact on him and Target employees.^6 This ignited a cascade of actions at the company to \"advance racial equity,\" including establishing an executive Racial Equity Action and Change committee to \"focus specifically on how we can drive lasting impact\" for Black employees and customers.^7 In the five years that have followed, Target\\'s DEI initiatives have transformed lives. Employees have found opportunities to grow their careers in inclusive environments, customers have felt valued through inclusive marketing campaigns, and minority-owned businesses have thrived thanks to supplier diversity programs. The evidence behind these programs is overwhelming: *Diverse companies perform better. Organizations with inclusive teams are 70% more likely to capture new markets.^8 *Consumers care about corporate values. Studies show 76% of consumers prefer brands that commit to social equity.^9 *Employees thrive in inclusive workplaces. Scaling back DEI leads to lower morale, higher turnover, and lost talent.^10 [ ]Sign the petition now to tell Target\\'s CEO and board of directors: Reinstate your critical DEI programs and take a stand for inclusion. This doesn\\'t end with Target; it\\'s about a larger fight against corporate backpedaling on inclusivity programs. Across the country, prominent businesses from Amazon to Walmart are scaling back or ending their commitments to DEI, caving to pressure from conservative activists and, now, the White House.^11 It\\'s up to us to send a clear message that inclusivity isn\\'t optional, and companies that abandon DEI will be held accountable by customers who are paying attention. By signing the petition, you\\'re joining our call for Target to: 1.Fully reinstate its DEI programs with transparency about progress toward these goals 2.Publicly reaffirm its commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion as the company\\'s core values 3.Continue investing in initiatives that support underrepresented communities, minority-owned businesses, and inclusive hiring practices [ ]If you agree, add your name to the petition now. By standing together, we can remind Target that their commitment to diversity isn\\'t just good business—it\\'s about doing what\\'s right. Thanks for all you do. –Garrett N., MoveOn member Sources: 5. \"Target was one of the most outspoken supporters of DEI. It\\'s changed its tune,\" CNN, February 3, 2025 6.

       "  'body': 'View this post on the web at video [ ] is emerging as a valuable tool on Substack, offering creators a new way to connect with their audience and build their creative business. Now many creators are making Live Video a regular part of their programming [ ]. Substackers such as Joanna Goddard and Dan Harris are launching recurring live shows, joining others who cover topics from cooking to politics to sports.With more publishers experimenting with this format, we’ve rounded up a few quick lessons about how to host a live show that builds community and grows your business—simply by talking into your phone.Learn more: How to go live [ ]We aim to provide a comprehensive set of tools for publishers across mediums, adding value for subscribers and expanding audiences within and beyond the Substack network. Even if video isn’t usually your preferred medium, it might pay to explore—our data shows that writers and creators who use video grow their revenue 2.5 times as fast as those who don’t.Whether you’re interested in experimenting or ready to build a regular live show, now is a great time to give it a try. Here are a few tips to help you make it happen.Launching your own live video show1. Try going live—then make it a habitGetting comfortable with live video is the first step toward making it a valuable part of your content strategy. Start by going live a few times to experiment with the format, engage with your audience in real time, and see what resonates. Once you’ve tested the waters, we recommend establishing a regular schedule of livestreams. When your audience knows when to tune in, it builds consistency, strengthens engagement, and creates community.Start by going live once a week and informing your subscribers via a dedicated Substack post so they know what to expect. MeidasTouch Network ’s announcement about their new show, Meidas Meet Up [ ], is a good example.Subscribers can tune in to watch your live videos from the app or on their desktop computers. If you’d like to maximize viewership while adding value for paid subscribers, you can keep the live video open to everyone while making the live chat within it exclusive to paid subscribers [ ], like Jessica Reed Kraus [ ] did during her conversation with Meghan McCain. This can offer another revenue stream and foster an exclusive community experience.2. Leverage collaborations to build a guest listCollaborations are a powerful growth tool that allow you to access the Substack network, introduce your work to new audiences, and grow your subscriber base. By inviting fellow creators to stream with you, you’re tapping into their community while offering your subscribers fresh perspectives and dynamic conversations.Looking for collaborators? Revisit publishers you’ve worked with in the past. Checking your audience overlap [ ] can also help identify valuable collaboration opportunities: it shows publications with the same subscribers on their email list, letting you spot potential partners. To explore these insights, go to Stats in your dashboard and select Subscriber Report.Since joining Substack, Jim Acosta has seen incredible growth by going live daily with other publishers. He’s even brought friends and colleagues onto the platform—many of whom weren’t on Substack before. After creating an account, they were able to jump straight into engaging discussions.Whether it’s a guest interview, a panel discussion, or a casual conversation, streaming with others can elevate your content, foster meaningful interactions, and attract new subscribers.“Live video on Substack brings newsmakers and influential voices together in a way we haven’t seen before on other platforms. I recommend inviting guests to join your live videos, whether they are established voices on Substack or new to the platform, as it is an excellent way to grow your audience and produce content your subscribers will love.” —Jim Acosta2. Post the recordingAfter your live session ends, the recording is automatically saved as a draft in your Substack posts. To make publishing even easier, we’ve introduced automated enhancements, which refine your recorded live video by trimming dead space at the beginning, enhancing audio and video quality, and reformatting the layout into a polished side-by-side view. This ensures that your video looks professional and is ready to share with minimal effort.Tyler Dunne goes live to break down the latest NFL news, then shares the recording so his community can keep the discussion going, even if they missed it live.3. Share clips on social media (and Notes)Maximize your reach by sharing short clips from your live video. Substack automatically generates ready-to-post highlights, making it easy to share with just a few clicks. Posting these clips on Notes, X, Instagram, and TikTok will help attract new subscribers and drive engagement back to your Substack publication.Learn more: How to create a clip [ ]Caroline Chambers shared a clip from her cooking demo on Notes, while Irene Kim (김애린) posted a highlight from her conversation with Kelly Williams on Instagram.4. Coming soon: Live video scheduling and RSVP emailsWe’re constantly improving the live video experience, and soon you’ll be able to schedule live sessions in advance and send RSVP emails to your audience. This will help you build anticipation and maximize attendance for your events.Substack Live Video is one of many tools we’re building to help writers and creators deepen their connection with their audience. Whether you’re hosting interviews with fellow Substackers, engaging subscribers in live Q&As, or sharing behind-the-scenes moments, live video makes it easy to bring your work to life in new ways. Even if you don’t typically use video, live shows offer a fresh way to engage with your audience that fits seamlessly into your existing workflow.To help you get started, we’re hosting a virtual masterclass covering best practices and key features for launching your own live show. This session is open to all creators and will take place on Zoom on Wednesday, March 19, from 2 to 3 p.m. ET. Sign up below to join!Unsubscribe ',\n",

       "  'body': \"GenAI and Machine Learning By Vincent GranvilleBy Vincent Granville Read this article on LinkedIn to join the conversationRead on LinkedIn In my recent research on cracking the deepest mathematical mystery, with version 2.0 published yesterday and available here as paper 51, I paved the way to solve a famous multi-century old math conjecture. The question is whether or not the digits of numbers such as π are evenly distributed. Currently, no one knows if the proportion of '1' even exists in these binary digit expansions. It could oscillate forever between 0% and 100% without ever converging. Of course, mathematicians believe that it is 50% in all cases. Trillions of digits have been computed for various constants, and they pass all randomness tests. In this article, I offer a new framework to solve this mystery once for all, for the number e. Dynamics of the digit counting function, seed leading to number e Rather than a closure on this topic, it is a starting point opening new research directions in several fields. Applications include cryptography, dynamical systems, quantum dynamics, high performance computing, LLMs to answer difficult math questions, and more. The highly innovative approach involves iterated self-convolutions of strings and working with numbers as large as 2^n + 1 at power 2^n, with n larger than 100,000 (versus 10,000 in the original version). No one before has ever analyzed the digits of such titanic numbers! To read the full article, participate in the AI challenge to test reasoning, math and pattern detection capabilities of LLMs, get the Python code, read about ground-breaking research, and see all the applications, follow this link. If you already looked at the Python code in version 1.0, note that the new version is 10 times faster with the Gmpy2 library, and now handles numbers even far bigger. I also tested it with different seeds, one of them producing the dynamics shown in the picture below, leading to chaos in much fewer iterations, making it more suitable for cryptography. Dynamics of the digit counting function, seed not related to number eKeep reading on LinkedIn ----------------------------------------This email was intended for Alexander Barriga, M.S.

[ ]Interview with Timescale AI’s Product Lead on Enhancing AI-Driven DatabasesInterview with Timescale’s AI Product Lead on Enhancing AI-Driven Databases [ ]AI Headlines: Week of 2/17Helix: Revolutionizing Humanoid Robotics at FigureTaken from Figure AI [ ], February 22, 2025.Figure AI captured headlines this last week with Helix [ ], a groundbreaking Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model for humanoid robots, potentially transforming the field of embodied AI. The “generalist” model runs on low-power embedded GPUs for real-world applications, including household chores like sorting groceries to use in logistics and manufacturing lines [ ].Helix works by combining visual data and language prompts to control a robot in real time [ ]. It can process both visual inputs and voice commands simultaneously, allowing robots to respond to and execute tasks without relying on extensive pre-programming.Helix\\'s key technical advancements include:Unified perception, language understanding, and learned controlDecoupled architecture with \"slow\" high-level thinking and \"fast\" real-time executionSingle neural network for all behaviors without task-specific fine-tuningFigure AI, now valued at $39.5 billion after a recent funding round, terminated its partnership with OpenAI [ ] as of this month to focus on in-house technology. The company generated the VLA by collecting about 500 hours of high-quality, multi-robot, multi-operator dataset of diverse teleoperated behaviors.As Helix continues to develop, it could significantly impact various industries, potentially reshaping human-robot interaction and the future of AI-powered robotics. However, experts note [ ] that while the demonstrations show impressive potential, there is cautious optimism about its applicability beyond controlled environments, and significant advancements are still needed before commercial deployment becomes a reality.Microsoft\\'s Majorana 1: A Quantum Leap in Computing?Taken from Quantum Insider [ ], February 22, 2025.Microsoft has unveiled Majorana 1 [ ], the world\\'s first quantum chip powered by a new Topological Core architecture, marking a significant milestone [ ] in quantum computing. This palm-sized processor features 8 qubits made from \\'topoconductors\\', a new class of materials, with the company reportedly saying [ ] that it has the elements to scale to 1 million qubits in the future.“Most of us grew up learning there are three main types of matter that matter: solid, liquid, and gas. Today, that changed [ ],” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in a post on X [ ]. “We believe this breakthrough will allow us to create a truly meaningful quantum computer not in decades, as some have predicted, but in years.”Key applications [ ] of this breakthrough technology could include:Solving the difficult chemistry problem of why certain materials corrode or crackCalculating the properties of catalysts to sustainably break down pollutants or plasticsHarnessing enzymes to boost soil fertility and increase yields to eliminate global hungerWhile NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang said we are 20 years [ ] from practical quantum computing for enterprises, breakthroughs like this have the potential to speed up the timeline dramatically.From Hype to Shutdown: Humane Acquired by HPTaken from InvogueSolutions [ ], February 22, 2025.Humane, the Bay Area start up that raised over $230 million for its Ai pin, announced its shutdown and sale to HP [ ] on February 19.Industry experts [ ] have called the shutdown as the “first high-profile startup flop of the artificial intelligence era.” Just under one year after the product’s November 2023 launch [ ], and despite an initial valuation of $850 million, HP Inc. has reportedly acquired Humane’s assets and team for approximately $116 million [ ].Here’s a quick timeline of Humane’s historic rise and fall:April 2024: Humane launches [ ] the AI Pin with significant hypeOctober 2024: Price dropped [ ] from $699 to $499February 19, 2025: Humane announces shutdownFebruary 28, 2025, 12:00 PM PST: All Humane AI Pins will cease to functionHumane was founded by former Apple executives Imran Chaudhri and Bethany Bongiorno [ ].

In an intimate setting, participants engaged in thought-provoking discussions on AI acceleration vs. safety, humanoid robots, artificial emotional intelligence, and humanity\\'s increasing dependency on AI.Key moments included a spirited debate between Wolf Ruzicka and Ed Melick on whether AI development should speed ahead or slow down. The consensus? There was none: except that these conversations are more necessary than ever. With curated roundtable discussions and reflections, attendees left with deeper insights and a renewed curiosity about AI’s societal role.A huge thank you to our hosts and organizers: Nathaniel Burola, Anna D\\'Aprile, Liel Zino, Maxwell Stern, Pranav Velleleth, Kyra B., Rin Nguyen, and Samuel Li. More AI Soirées to come!🌁 SF Bay Area: DeepSeek for FoundersNo pitches, no buzzwords, just real conversations. The GenAI Collective\\'s DeepSeek for Founders event in San Francisco provided a space for builders and problem-solvers to discuss how open-source AI can drive real impact. Hosted by Chappy and Mary in a stunning venue overlooking the city, the gathering felt more like a conversation among friends than a traditional startup event.Founders broke into small groups to share strategies, lessons learned, and practical insights on integrating AI, reducing costs, and navigating the evolving landscape. The relaxed yet high-energy atmosphere fostered genuine connections and left attendees excited about what’s next.🌆 Chicago: How AI Is Innovating the Physical WorldChicago’s AI community came together at mHUB for an electrifying discussion on AI’s impact on datacenters and robotics.

If you missed it, keep an eye out for future mHUB events!Partner SpotlightTimescale [ ]: Redefining AI Integration for the Modern DeveloperIn an insightful conversation on the GenAI Collective podcast Collective Intelligence, host Thomas Joshi interviewed Avthar Sewrathan, AI Product Lead at Timescale. The discussion revolved around how Timescale is revolutionizing AI integration by extending PostgreSQL capabilities, eliminating the need for separate vector databases. Sewrathan detailed how PGVector Scale and PG AI are streamlining AI-powered data retrieval and enhancing developer experience.Bridging AI and Databases During the interview, Joshi posed the fundamental question: “What challenges are developers facing when integrating AI with databases?” Sewrathan responded: “Developers need AI applications that provide reliable, accurate answers while avoiding the headache of managing separate systems.”Joshi explored the limitations of vector databases, asking: “Why would developers prefer extending PostgreSQL rather than adopting a specialized vector database?” Sewrathan explained, “Managing a separate vector database requires additional infrastructure, synchronization, and learning a new query language. Our goal is to let developers use the tools they already know and love while minimizing infrastructure complexity.”By extending PostgreSQL with PGVector Scale and PG AI, Timescale enables AI-powered applications to operate seamlessly within existing relational databases.Key Offerings Timescale\\'s latest innovations address major AI application challenges:PGVector Scale – Enhances PostgreSQL’s vector search performance, handling billions of embeddings efficiently.PG AI – Automates embedding creation and synchronization, reducing maintenance burdens.Vectorizer – Ensures real-time updates, keeping applications up to date.“These tools make AI integration smoother and more scalable without requiring developers to switch to an entirely new database,” Sewrathan emphasized.By combining PostgreSQL’s stability with advanced AI capabilities, Timescale empowers developers to build scalable, AI-driven applications without unnecessary complexity. With PGVector Scale and PG AI, Timescale strengthens its position as a leader in AI-driven database solutions, paving the way for the next generation of AI applications.Learn more about PG AI [ ] and subscribe to the Collective Intelligence podcast here [ ].Join the Community! 💬 Slack: GenAI Collective [ ]𝕏 Twitter / X: @GenAICollective [ ]🧑\\u200d💼 LinkedIn: The GenAI Collective [ ]📸 Instagram: @GenAICollective [ ]🎙️ Collective Intelligence Podcast [ ]🌎 Start a Chapter [ ]👷 Join the Team [ ]Want to feature your insights?

       "  'body': 'Strategy for beginners, how Starbucks lost its soul, and a food safety pointer (Issue #274)The Medium Newsletter ( newsletter byThe Medium Blog ( 24, 2025∙4 min read∙View on Medium ( anyone ever asked you to \"be more strategic\"? Here\\'s what that meansStrategy for beginners, how Starbucks lost its soul, and a food safety pointer (Issue #274)\"Being told you need to be more strategic is common feedback for senior engineers,\" writes CTO and technical advisor Dan Pupius ( on Medium. (He was Medium\\'s Head of Engineering a decade ago.)It\\'s a phrase I\\'ve heard a lot throughout my career, and it\\'s usually thrown around without a precise definition. The gist seems to be to work smarter, not harder, but it\\'s unclear how to apply that phrase to the messiness of inbound emails and Slacks, some of which might simply require hard work.For some background, I dug through the Medium archive and found this story ( by product designer Stephanie Irwin ( Irwin draws a clear distinction between a plan and a strategy. A plan is basically a to-do list, but a strategy is a set of choices that position you in a way to win. Or, in the words of Pupius, strategy is \"a framework that guides decision making.\" If you\\'re doing it right, you\\'ll have defined your priorities in advance, giving yourself permission to say no to work that doesn\\'t serve your goals.And if you\\'re not strategic? As Irwin explains, \"You may feel incredibly busy, yet months pass… and that dream or goal you have still hasn\\'t happened.\"Pupius\\'s example: You\\'re an engineer whose product seems to be getting buggier (that\\'s not great) and you want to catch issues before they hit production. An easy, not-super-strategic solution? Simply add more tests and/or a manual QA phase. A better, more strategic path: End-to-end automated tests of critical user flows. This gives you a framework for understanding what kinds of tests you want to add, and how you\\'ll prioritize them.For a far deeper dive into the decades (centuries, even!) of meaning hidden behind that \"be more strategic\" comment you might hear during a performance review, I recommend spending some time with Roger Martin ( Medium archive ( He\\'s written a book on this topic (Playing to Win)\\u200a-\\u200aand, in this brief history ( traces business strategy all the way back to a 1911 Harvard Business School course on military strategy ( In both military and business contexts, as Martin points out, the art is to achieve a sense of equilibrium (peace, basically) between yourself and your competitors. You want to \"get your desired positioning and have your competitors largely satisfied with theirs\\u200a-\\u200ato create as positive-sum a game as circumstances allow.\"- Harris Sockel☕ Your responses to our newsletter about \"third places\" (and Starbucks)Last Thursday, we sent a newsletter about Starbucks\\' attempt to reclaim its position as America\\'s go-to coffee shop and \"third place\" (a zone of connectedness and community between work and home). Many of you responded thoughtfully, on both Starbucks\\' business prospects (it\\'s not doing well lately) and the importance of \"third places.\" Here are a few responses that stood out to us:I lived in Seattle when Starbucks was in its early days ( It still had a \"3rd Place\" vibe then, but I had a front seat to the changes. IMHO, the two biggest things Starbucks did to ruin the brand:1) Replace skillful baristas with push-button, automated espresso machines, eliminating the art and know-how of pulling espresso. This created an army of \"fake baristas\" and removed the craft from the coffee. […]2) Centralized and standardized food offerings. This is the biggest reason I tend to avoid Starbucks. Their food looks anemic, generic, and totally unappealing. In the old days, they contracted with local bakeries and vendors and had quality items that varied somewhat among stores. Now, it all comes in shrink-wrapped from a central hub.[…] As with so many businesses they let \"efficiency\" and the bean counters steer decisions that have impacted their brand for the worse.\\u200a-\\u200aA. Wyatt ( to reclaim the community/coffeehouse vibe ( is a big lift for a corporation whose actions have consistently degraded that experience over the years. Actions need to align with that aspiration and should be directed within first. Get your house in order before inviting company over. Improving the barista experience will improve the customer experience.\\u200a-\\u200aR. A. Jones ( Some practical wisdomFood expiration dates are confusing because there\\'s no national system. A rule of thumb ( someone should have taught me in elementary school: \"Use by\" is a safety threshold (don\\'t cross it unless you\\'ve frozen the item beforehand); \"Best before\" is a quality threshold (fine to cross if you\\'re okay sacrificing flavor or texture).···Deepen your understanding every day with the Medium Newsletter.

( image: ( # OpenAI thinks we’ll have superintelligent AI by 2027—but Microsoft’s CEO isn’t buying itAlways good to take these things with a grain of salt, _buuut_ OpenAI Chief Product Officer Kevin Weil [apparently thinks]( the company could achieve “ASI” (artificial superintelligence, where AIs can do everything _better_ than humans) by 2027… _if not earlier_.View image: ( image link: ( They must really believe this over there, because according to a [report from The Information]( OpenAI is filling investors in on some_ absolutely wild_ spending plans.**OpenAI is projecting to…*** Spend $13B on Microsoft's servers in 2025 and $28B by 2028.* Burn through $7B this year and $20B by 2027.* Drop $325B on total compute from 2025-2030.* Finally turn profitable after [building Stargate]( (their next-gen compute infrastructure) in 2030.**Here's why that ASI claim is raising eyebrows:**Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella thinks the [exact opposite]( In a [fascinating interview]( Nadella pointed out that we're getting way ahead of ourselves with all this AGI hype.His [take]( “Self-claiming some AGI milestone, that's just nonsensical benchmark hacking to me.”Youtube: Satya Nadella – Microsoft’s AGI Plan & Quantum Breakthrough ( Satya, the real benchmark for AI is GDP growth:** * Right now, developed economies are growing at 2% (_zero_ after inflation).* For AI to match the Industrial Revolution, we'd need to see _7-10% growth._* That would mean an extra _$10 trillion _in value. _Every. Single. Year._Nadella also [explained why]( he believes no single company will dominate AI through one superior model—because open-source will prevent any “winner-take-all” scenario. And even if you build an amazing model, you still need massive infrastructure to run it—storage, compute power, and agent environments across dozens of global regions.As if to twist the knife, he added that you can't serve the world from “one data center in Texas” (_sick Stargate burn_).Because of all this, he said “_one person running away with one model and building it all may not happen,”—_which is basically him throwing cold water on OpenAI's investment thesis. As a reminder, that thesis = OpenAI could “[maybe capture the light cone of all future value in the universe]( by creating AGI. **That said, Nadella's actually thrilled about the coming “**[**overbuild**]( of AI compute capacity in 2027-2028.** As all the tech giants pour [hundreds of billions]( into data centers, Microsoft’s choosing to both build AND [lease a lot]( **Why lease? Because:*** Massive infrastructure buildout will drive prices down. * Like how the [fiber buildouts]( of the dotcom era gave us the internet, today’s data center buildouts could have similar long term benefits. * Countries, not just companies, are racing to deploy compute, too. So while OpenAI is betting everything on superintelligence, Microsoft is preparing for a world where AI becomes a commodity—powered by a mix of open and closed-source models running on globally distributed infrastructure.After all, whether or not superintelligence arrives by 2027, somebody's gotta provide all that compute.

Check it out.-------------------------LAST WEEK\\'S BREAKTHROUGHS-------------------------In last week’s newsletter ( I asked you to let go of a lie you’ve been telling yourself.This hit close to home for Jason:“Your email this week hit on the topic I\\'ve been grappling withfor decades. Graduating high school, I took what many wouldconsider the ‘safe route’ and ignored the things I was passionateabout and felt I was decent at. I told myself I could always comeback to it and do it as a side business or even somedaytransition careers after I\\'ve saved enough for retirement andpaid off my debts. As the years went on I continued to keep thismindset, always viewing my interest as a potential businessopportunity, or my way out of the career I chose that has neverbeen satisfying to me. I\\'ve spent a lot of money over the lasttwo decades on courses, hardware, software, always keeping up todate with programs, and/or any other new trend in the industry Ialways envisioned myself going into. I\\'ve told myself I need tostay serious about it if it will ever happen.Then I got married and had kids. Priorities changed and financeshad to be focused on other areas. New responsibilities took overand the idea of changing careers while my kids are still at homeseemed less and less possible. Over the last three years itstarted to occur to me that it may never happen.Your email about lying to yourself hit me square in the jaw. I\\'vespent so much time, energy, and money on something that Ihonestly never took seriously enough to make that leap. All thewhile I\\'ve had a toxic relationship with my dream, always viewingit as my way out instead of using it as a tool to keep megrounded and present. I had a false sense of perfectionismwhenever I would sit down with it, and it would leave mefrustrated. I never accepted that it could be a hobby, a way forme to escape the stressors and pressures of life, of theday-to-day business that I didn\\'t always enjoy. Instead I wouldlie to myself every time I thought about my interest, reliving myyouth and never letting go of it.I had an overwhelming feeling of finally being able to accept itfor what it truly is. A lie I tell myself over and over again. Ifeel more at peace with the idea of never making that transition.It may very well never become anything more than a hobby, andmaybe that\\'s exactly what it needs to be, and probably what italways should have been.”Letting go of one lie helped Katie become a new person:“I actually discovered a lie last week, it was along the lines ofI’m so tired that I can’t get out of bed early. I allowed mywake-up time to be set by my two pre-school boys and would rollunwillingly, moodily, groggily out of bed when they woke up,immediately having to deal with their hunger demands and morningmoods. Things were tense, angry snappy mum could be around allday and late into the night.Since my mood tends to set the tone for the whole household wewere all a little grumpy and short with each other, me notwanting to engage in the games the kids wanted to play and themnot wanting to do anything I’d ask. I decided one day to get upat 5 A.M. and managed to get nearly three whole hours for myselfbefore anyone else got up, it was magical, I was a differentperson. They became different little people. And I’ve noticed ashift in our whole household over the past two weeks as I’vecontinued it.It’s so simple: go to bed early, wake up early. Take the time formyself at the beginning of the day rather than hoping I might getsome at the end of it (I never did). I actually look forward togetting up each day! I’m getting work done, I’m exercising, thedog gets a walk, I get to see the sunrise, maybe I’m even justwatching a movie—it doesn’t matter, it’s a slice of my day that’ssolely for me.”To end, a reader with a recent break-up is finally acknowledgingthe truth:“I\\'ve been telling myself and my therapist for a long time nowthat I\\'m fine, I\\'m doing well, I\\'m good at being on my own. Andwhilst in the past this has been true, three months postbreak-up, I realize that I am lonely, not just alone. That I misshaving companionship and connection and silly little in-jokes andthat my aliveness and exploration have tanked.It feels very vulnerable and raw to be this honest that I\\'mmissing something and that I feel like an island.You\\'re right that true growth is acknowledging this, honoring thefeelings of grief and isolation, yet reaching out to friends andformulating a plan to cultivate a stronger platonic socialcircle, rather than romance-based.”As always, send your breakthroughs by simply replying to thisemail.

       "  'body': '[YouTube]( | [SV AI Think Tank Meetup ]( [LinkedIn]( | [Your Free AI PRD]( bits for a Byte:** What’s old is new again, and Paul Graham hit the nail on the head—understanding your users’ problems is _everything_. That applies to startups, AI, and even Business Intelligence. The problem? Too many tools, too much data chaos, and too little strategy. The solution? AI-driven insights _done right_. This week, we’re diving into BI evolution, AI’s biggest bottlenecks, and how AI agents are quietly reshaping industries. **Let’s get to it!**What’s old is new again and Paul Graham hits the nail on the proverbial head when he snarkley shares that understanding our users’ problems has and continues to be the most important component of starting a startup or IMHO creating any product.Tweet: ( Here’s Why Over 4 Million Professionals Read Morning BrewView image: ( image link: ( * Business news explained in plain English* Straight facts, zero fluff, & plenty of puns* 100% free[See for yourself]( image: ( # ~**Let’s Get To It!**~----------View image: ( image link: ( View image: ( Welcome, To 8 bits for a Byte!# Here\\'s what caught my eye in the world of AI this week:View image: ( 1. **The Evolution of BI & the AI-First Future**.**Bit #1: Business Intelligence Never Stands Still**BI has evolved from rigid IT-controlled systems to flexible, self-service tools—and now, AI-driven analytics. Each wave solved old problems while creating new ones. The challenge today? Too many tools, inconsistent data, and a struggle between governance and self-service..🔹 BI has gone through four major phases—legacy BI (1990s), self-service (2000s), governance-focused (2010s), and AI-driven (2020s)..🔹 Modern BI tools are fragmented, forcing companies to use multiple platforms for governance, exploration, and modeling..🔹 AI is entering BI, but without structured business logic, it struggles to deliver meaningful insights..💡** Actionable Impact:**Leaders should evaluate BI solutions that balance governance with flexibility. Look for AI-powered BI tools that integrate deeply with data models like dbt to maintain accuracy while enabling self-service insights..## **Bit #2: 1990s – The Legacy Era of BI**BI in the 90s was slow, expensive, and IT-controlled, relying on tools like SAP BusinessObjects, IBM Cognos, and Oracle BI. Reports were pre-aggregated in OLAP cubes, making changes time-consuming and inflexible..🔹 Strength: High governance and structured reporting..🔹 Challenge: High costs, slow report generation, and dependence on IT for insights..🔹 Reports were often outdated due to overnight ETL processes, limiting real-time decision-making..💡** Actionable Impact:** If your organization still relies on legacy BI, it’s time to modernize. Moving to cloud-native BI platforms enables real-time analytics, scalability, and faster decision-making..## **Bit #3: 2000s – The Self-Service Revolution**BI tools like Tableau, Power BI, and Qlik democratized data access, allowing business users to analyze data visually—no IT required..🔹 Strength: Faster insights and intuitive interfaces..🔹 Challenge: Data chaos—no centralized governance led to conflicting reports..🔹 Data extracts often became outdated, causing inconsistencies across teams..💡** Actionable Impact:** If self-service BI led to data silos in your company, implement centralized data governance using modern modeling layers like dbt or LookML..## **Bit #4: 2010s – The Return of Governance & Modern Data Modeling**With cloud data warehouses like Snowflake and BigQuery, BI shifted toward governance-focused platforms like Looker. dbt emerged as a key transformation tool, enabling SQL-based data modeling..🔹 Strength: Centralized governance and scalable cloud analytics..🔹 Challenge: Bottlenecks—data teams controlled models, slowing self-service..🔹 Companies adopted hybrid BI workflows, mixing dbt, Looker, Tableau, and Sigma..💡** Actionable Impact:** If BI feels fragmented, consolidate workflows by defining clear governance policies and choosing BI tools that integrate directly with your transformation layer..## **Bit #5: 2020s – The AI-First BI Landscape**BI today is fragmented, with companies using multiple tools for different needs—leading to inefficiencies. AI is emerging as a game-changer, but without structured business logic, it falls short..🔹 Strength: AI-powered analytics, automation, and embedded intelligence..🔹 Challenge: Too many BI tools, inconsistent metrics, and lack of a single source of truth..🔹 Traditional BI vendors (Looker, Tableau, Power BI) have slowed innovation due to acquisitions..💡** Actionable Impact:** Look for BI platforms that unify governance, flexibility, and AI-driven insights, reducing reliance on multiple tools while maintaining accuracy..## **Bit #6: The Rise of Next-Gen BI Vendors**New players like **Omni** and **Inventive** are addressing BI’s biggest challenges—merging governance with AI-powered automation..🔹 **Omni** combines deep data modeling with self-service, enabling flexible, governed analytics..🔹 **Inventive** is revolutionizing embedded analytics with AI-powered agents that automate report generation and customer interactions..🔹 Both are reshaping BI by integrating with modern data stacks (dbt, cloud warehouses) for seamless workflows..💡** Actionable Impact:** Explore emerging BI solutions that consolidate analytics, reduce SQL dependency, and enhance AI-driven decision-making..## **Bit #7: AI is Transforming BI—But Needs Structure**Text-to-SQL and AI copilots are making BI more accessible, but they rely on structured business logic to provide accurate insights..🔹 AI can automate data queries, but without a well-defined data model, results may be inconsistent..🔹 Governance remains critical—AI should assist decision-making, not create data chaos..🔹 The future of BI blends AI-powered automation with strong data modeling to ensure trustworthy insights..💡** Actionable Impact:** Ensure your AI-driven BI tools are backed by a structured semantic layer to maintain data accuracy and consistency..## **Bit #8: The Future of BI – AI-First, But Governed**BI is shifting towards AI-driven automation, but structured data models remain essential for reliable insights. The leaders behind Looker’s success are now building the AI-first BI era, ensuring governance doesn’t get left behind..🔹 AI is making BI more intuitive, but unstructured AI-driven queries risk generating misleading insights..🔹 The next generation of BI will integrate AI with strong governance, enabling both automation and accuracy..🔹 Companies that adopt AI-first BI while maintaining data governance will gain a competitive advantage..💡** Actionable Impact:** Adopt BI solutions that prioritize AI-driven insights _and_ structured governance—ensuring both speed and accuracy in decision-making..**Final Thought:** The future of BI isn’t just AI—it’s AI + structured data. Leaders who embrace AI-powered governance will drive the next wave of data-driven success.View image: ( # Quote of the weekView image: ( 2. I deeply resonate with this quote from[ Fei-Fei Li]( — it perfectly captures the essence of how AI should be approached. AI is not here to replace human intelligence but to enhance it, serving as a powerful tool to amplify creativity, problem-solving, and innovation..This understanding is _crucial_ for successfully implementing AI solutions for customers. Too often, organizations view AI as merely an automation tool, missing its potential to unlock new opportunities, insights, and human potential. When we integrate AI thoughtfully—aligning it with our values, strategy, and vision—we don’t just optimize processes; we empower people, foster innovation, and drive meaningful transformation. AI, when used right, is not just about efficiency—it’s about elevating human ingenuity to new heights.View image: ( View image: ( image link: ( 3. [Cracking the Code of Business Leadership]( love the clarity and structure in [Timothy T Tiryaki, PhD ]( breakdown! He has distilled the essence of business leadership into a strategic framework that is simple, actionable and insightful.**A few thoughts:**1️⃣ **The North Star as a Competitive Advantage** – Many organizations chase revenue and profitability but neglect the organizational engine that sustains them. Companies that invest in culture, leadership, and systems thinking often outperform competitors in the long run.2️⃣ **AI as an Enabler Across All Three Areas** – AI isn’t just for optimizing operations (bottom-line growth); it’s also transforming business models (top-line growth) and reshaping leadership and culture (organizational capabilities). Strategic AI adoption could be the key to full integration.3️⃣ **From Systems Thinking to Systems Being** – Love this phrase! It highlights that leadership isn’t just about understanding complexity but embodying it. The best leaders don’t just \"manage\" systems—they create an ecosystem where strategy, people, and performance thrive together.Curious—how do you see AI playing into the development of organizational capabilities? Many leaders see AI as just an efficiency tool, but I think it can be a powerful enabler of leadership and culture too.View image: ( View image: ( image link: ( 4. [AI as a Force Multiplier: Unlocking Business Potential]( are increasingly investing in AI to enhance operations and boost business outcomes. However, many struggle to realize AI\\'s full potential due to bureaucratic constraints and skill gaps. Emphasizing collaboration between AI and human workers can unlock greater efficiency and innovation.## **Bit: Why isn’t AI delivering its full promise?**AI is a game-changer, but many organizations fail to realize its full potential due to bureaucracy, skill gaps, and outdated workflows. Instead of replacing humans, AI should act as a **force multiplier**, amplifying human capabilities and accelerating business outcomes.### **Key Takeaways:**🔹 **Augmentation, Not Automation** – The most successful AI implementations **enhance** human work rather than replace it. Organizations focusing on AI to reduce headcount often see low ROI.🔹 **AI Multiplier Effect** – AI can **increase efficiency and innovation** by 1.2x to 3.2x, but **only if businesses remove organizational constraints** like slow decision-making and rigid budgeting.🔹 **Overcoming Barriers** – Common AI roadblocks include **poor data quality, excessive bureaucracy, lack of AI trust, and skill gaps**. Fixing these allows AI to drive real business value.### **Action Plan: What You Can Do Today**✅ **Help Employees Work Effectively with AI** – Invest in **AI training**, including **prompt engineering and AI-augmented decision-making**.✅ **Fix Workflows to Remove AI Barriers** – Identify **bottlenecks** like slow approvals and rigid processes that **prevent AI from scaling**.✅ **Adopt Agile Funding Models** – Move beyond **static budgets** and enable **dynamic funding** to quickly seize AI-driven opportunities.**Final Thought:** AI isn’t a magic fix—it’s a tool. Organizations that optimize workflows, empower employees, and rethink governance will unlock AI’s true potential. **Are you ready to compete at the speed of AI?** 🚀The[ Business Agility Institute (BAI)]( is a pioneering research and advocacy organization dedicated to transforming businesses for the future.

Strategic MindsetI had the chance to organize a book club on _Testing Business Ideas_, led by none other than [David Bland]( himself. Total game-changer! It opened my eyes to just how efficiently—and affordably—you can test ideas before going all in. This is a fantastic framework for resilient leadership! It highlights the shift from execution-focused thinking to outcome-driven decision-making. Here are three key takeaways that reinforce the importance of digging deeper:### **Key Takeaways:**🔹 **Challenge Assumptions** – Don’t just build what was requested; question if it should be built at all. The real risk isn’t execution—it’s irrelevance.🔹 **Validate with Evidence** – Customer requests should be examined through the lens of actual needs, not taken as orders. Seek proof, not just opinions.🔹 **Measure the Right Things** – Success isn’t just hitting deadlines and budgets. Reducing risk, learning faster, and making better bets drive long-term impact.### **Actionable Impact:**Shifting your team’s mindset from **\"Are we doing this right?\"** to **\"Are we doing the right thing?\"** is a critical mindset in the 21st century that corporations must have to win the AI battle. Winning organizations will thrive on evidence, adaptability, and smart risk-taking. 🚀View image: ( Until next time, take it one bit at a time!RobThank you for scrolling all the way to the end!

Ifyou have questions, we're here to help. support@upgrade.comPersonal loans made through Upgrade feature Annual PercentageRates (APRs) of 7.99%-35.99%. All personal loans have a 1.85% to9.99% origination fee, which is deducted from the loan proceeds.Lowest rates require Autopay and paying off a portion of existingdebt directly. Loans feature repayment terms of 24 to 84 months.For example, if you receive a $10,000 loan with a 36-month termand a 17.59% APR (which includes a 13.94% yearly interest rateand a 5% one-time origination fee), you would receive $9,500 inyour account and would have a required monthly payment of$341.48. Over the life of the loan, your payments would total$12,293.46. The APR on your loan may be higher or lower and yourloan offers may not have multiple term lengths available. Actualrate depends on credit score, credit usage history, loan term,and other factors. Late payments or subsequent charges and feesmay increase the cost of your fixed rate loan.

[ ][IMG] This attempted silencing comes just as we\\'re seeing real impact. After just one week of our \"Nobody Elected Elon\" campaign, Trump released an official statement that Musk has \"no actual or formal authority to make government decisions.\"^1 Instead of backing down, we must double down. If we can raise the money, we will secure alternative billboard locations in key areas, create mobile billboard trucks that can\\'t be censored, and could even develop digital ad campaigns that billboard companies can\\'t block. The billboards are working. Let\\'s show them that attempts to silence us will only make us louder.

( image: ( # Google\\'s new AI scientist is already making real discoveries.Earlier this week, Google Research unveiled their new [“AI Co-Scientist” system]( built with [Gemini 2.0]( that aims to help researchers generate and test new hypotheses ([paper]( And guess what? They\\'ve already validated it works through [actual laboratory experiments]( how it works.** AI Co-Scientist acts like a collaborative research partner, using a coalition of specialized AI agents that:* Generate novel research hypotheses.* Evaluate them through simulated scientific debates.* Refine ideas through tournaments and evolution.* Use web search and other tools to fact-check claims.* Break complex problems into testable sub-components.Unlike other “AI for science” tools that just summarize existing research, this one aims to uncover genuinely new scientific knowledge.Google says the tool is meant to assist scientists, not replace them (_hence the “co”)_. Think of it as an AI-powered brainstorming partner that can help identify promising research directions.**For a deeper dive on how this works, watch this:**Youtube: Googles New AI Co Scientist Just Changed EVERYTHING (AI co-scientist Explained) ( tested it in three increasingly complex biomedical challenges:**1. **Drug repurposing**: The AI suggested existing drugs to fight leukemia—and when tested in the lab, they actually killed cancer cells at safe doses.2. **Target discovery:** It also found new treatment targets for liver scarring that worked when tested on human liver tissue.3. **Evolution mechanisms (the wildest one): ** 1. Professor Penadés at Imperial College London spent 10 years figuring out how superbugs dodge antibiotics by stealing virus tails to spread between species.2. He gave the AI the same puzzle, and in just 48 hours, it proposed the [exact same solution]( four other promising ideas his team had never considered.3. _And no, the AI hadn\\'t seen his unpublished research._““I literally had to stop shopping and sit down when I saw the results…It\\'s spectacular.\"“ — Professor José R PenadésFYI, if you’re a research organization, Google is opening access to their Co-Scientists system through a “[Trusted Tester Program]( this matters:** Drug development and scientific research are painfully slow—and [painfully expensive]( An AI system that can generate plausible hypotheses and predict which ones are worth testing could massively accelerate discovery. Google’s Co-Scientist isn’t the company’s only effort in this area—[Isomorphic Labs]( a spin-out from DeepMind, developed its own AI drug discovery platform and has [increased its R&D spending]( by 4x over the past year to get drugs into [clinical trial by 2026]( other AI drug companies clamor for more lab data, Isomorphic [takes a radical stance]( It doesn\\'t even have a lab, arguing that better algorithms and thinking—not more data or experiments—are what\\'s needed to transform drug discovery.**BTW, get ready for lab automation to become a bigger deal with the **[rise of cloud labs]( too.** Remote labs like [Emerald]( are using robotic systems that can run 500 experiments simultaneously alongside language models that help analyze test results._You seeing what we’re seeing?

Member\\'s Rapid Rewards account number must be entered at the time of booking Member\\'s qualifying flight to earn a promotional Companion Pass valid for use between August 7, 2025 and October 8, 2025. A qualifying one-way flight for this promotion is a one-way flight on Southwest Airlines® from an origin city to a destination city, including any intermediate stops and/or connections on Southwest Airlines. A qualifying round trip flight for this promotion is a round trip flight on Southwest Airlines from an origin city to a destination city and back to the originating airport or carrier-recognized co-terminal. Valid on new reservations booked within the Promotion Period for travel during the Travel Period only. Travel booked or flown prior to registration for this promotion is not eligible for this promotional Companion Pass offer. Redemption reservations and Cash + Points bookings qualify for this promotional offer. Cash + Points bookings will earn Rapid Rewards points, tier qualifying points for A-List and A-List Preferred status, and Companion Pass qualifying points on the portion of the base fare that is paid with dollars. Companion Pass, charter flights, group travel, and Southwest Vacations® packages do not qualify as one-way or round trip flights for this promotion. Changes made within the Promotion Period is allowed if the qualifying travel is still completed in the Travel Period. Changes made to any itinerary after the Promotion Period may eliminate qualification for this promotion. The promotional Companion Pass is valid from August 7, 2025 through October 8, 2025 and allows you to designate one person to fly with you, free of airline charges (does not include taxes and fees from $5.60 one-way) on flights purchased by you, booked through Southwest, and completed between August 7, 2025 and October 8, 2025.

No Rapid Rewards points nor tier or Companion Pass qualifying points will be awarded for flights taken by the Companion when flying on a promotional Companion Pass or Companion Pass reservation. You may change your designated Companion up to three times while you have promotional Companion Pass. If you earn Companion Pass in 2025 by earning 135,000 Companion Pass qualifying points or flying 100 qualifying flights, any changes to your designated Companion during the time you have a promotional Companion Pass will reduce the number of changes you can make to your designated Companion in the 2025 calendar year. For example, if you earn a promotional Companion Pass through this promotion, change your designated Companion twice during the validity period for promotional Companion Pass, and later in 2025 earn Companion Pass, you would only be able to change your designated Companion one more time in 2025. Companion Pass is nontransferable. All Rapid Rewards rules and regulations apply and can be found at Southwest.com/rrterms. Southwest reserves the right to amend, suspend, or change the Rapid Rewards program and/or Rapid Rewards program rules at any time without notice. Rapid Rewards Members do not acquire property rights in accrued points. The number of points needed for a particular Southwest flight is set by Southwest and will vary depending on destination, time, day of travel, demand, fare type, point redemption rate, and other factors, and is subject to change at any time until the booking is confirmed.

       "  'body': ' Dear MoveOn member, It\\'s official: Donald Trump has started banning books. Last week, he ordered schools on military bases or run by the military to remove from school shelves any books that discussed equity or discrimination.^1 One of the first books to be banned is called \"Freckleface Strawberry,\" a children\\'s book written by actress Julianne Moore that tells a story of a young girl learning to love her freckles. Yes, you read that correctly. They also banned \"No Truth Without Ruth,\" a children\\'s book about the life of Ruth Bader Ginsburg.^2 This is despicable and dystopian, and it requires us to respond boldly and with absolute clarity. MoveOn is working around the clock to stop Trump\\'s efforts, including by printing our award-winning \"LeVar Burton Says Read Banned Books\" design on tote bags that will serve as mini-billboards against Trump\\'s actions when you take them shopping, to a coffee shop, to school, to work, and around your community. Every single dollar we make from these tote bags will go directly toward our work to stop Trump from implementing his radical plans across the country—and building the grassroots organization we will need to wrest power away from him in the midterm elections next year by flipping Congress blue. [ ]Click here or on the image below to order your \"LeVar Burton Says Read Banned Books\" tote now and join the fight to stop book bans. [ ][IMG] Make no mistake, Alexander, banning these books is just the beginning. Trump and his puppeteer Elon Musk have also moved to open bogus investigations into PBS, which aired \"Reading Rainbow\" with LeVar Burton for 23 years, and NPR in an effort to take them off the air and shut down independent public media. They want to stifle free thinking and force-feed our kids radical right-wing ideology, and we will not let them get away with it. You can help build the overwhelming pressure we will need to stop Trump\\'s efforts by proudly displaying your banned books tote bag, talking to your community about the dangers of censorship, and continuing to borrow or buy the books Donald Trump wants banned. [ ]Click here to order your \"LeVar Burton Says Read Banned Books\" tote bag now. Thanks for all you do. –Sarah, Mona, Chris, Eric, and the rest of the team Source: 1. \"Donald Trump Administration Book Ban Detailed for Some US Schools,\" Yahoo, February 17, 2025 2. Ibid. Want to support MoveOn\\'s work? Donald Trump and his MAGA allies expect us to give up. But we will not give them what they want. We will never stop working to defend our fundamental freedoms and protect our democracy. MoveOn has been leading the movement against right-wing extremism for 26 years, and we promise you that we will still be here every step of the way forward.

To be eligible for this bonus offer, account must be open and not in default at the time of fulfillment. Earning in the Rewards Program: You’ll earn points on purchases of products and services, minus returns or refunds, made with a Rapid Rewards® Credit Card by you or an authorized user of the account. Buying products and services with your card, in most cases, will count as a purchase; however, the following types of transactions won’t count as a purchase and won’t earn points: balance transfers, cash advances and other cash-like transactions, lottery tickets, casino gaming chips, race track wagers or similar betting transactions, any checks that access your account, interest, unauthorized or fraudulent charges, and fees of any kind, including an annual fee, if applicable. 2 points: You’ll earn 2 points for each $1 spent on purchases made directly with Southwest Airlines®, including flight, inflight, Southwest® gift card, and Southwest Vacations® package purchases, and at participating Rapid Rewards® hotel and rental car partners. 2 points: You’ll earn 2 points for each $1 spent on purchases in the local transit and commuting rewards category. 2 points: You’ll earn 2 points for each $1 spent on purchases in the following rewards categories: internet, cable, and phone services; select streaming services. 1 point: You’ll earn 1 point for each $1 spent on all other purchases. 1 point on balance transfers: You’ll earn 1 point for each $1 of the first $10,000 of balance transfers made during the first 90 days from your original account open date. 3,000 bonus points each account anniversary year: You’ll receive 3,000 bonus points each account anniversary year. “Account anniversary year” means the year beginning with your account open date through the anniversary of your account open date, and each 12 months after that. Information about earning/transferring points to Southwest Airlines®: Points earned during a billing cycle will be automatically transferred to Southwest Airlines after the end of each billing cycle. Losing points: You’ll immediately lose all points that haven’t been transferred to Southwest Airlines if your card account status changes, or your card account is closed for program misuse, fraudulent activities, or other reasons described in the terms of the Rewards Program Agreement. For important information about Chase rewards categories, see chase.com/RewardsCategoryFAQs. For more information about the Rapid Rewards® Plus Card rewards program, you can see the latest Rewards Program Agreement at chase.com/swapluscard/rewardsagreement and it will also be available for cardmembers after logging in to chase.com and will be mailed for new or changed accounts. Southwest® EarlyBird Check-In®: Each anniversary year you will be reimbursed for the purchase of up to 2 EarlyBird Check-In services made with your Southwest Rapid Rewards® Plus Credit Card. Each EarlyBird Check-In service means a purchase made for EarlyBird Check-In one-way, per Passenger. Anniversary year means the year beginning with your account open date through the first statement date after your account open date anniversary, and the 12 monthly billing cycles after that each year. If you switch to this product from another Chase credit card, your account open date is the date the switch to the Southwest Rapid Rewards® Plus Credit Card is completed. EarlyBird Check-In provides automatic check-in before the traditional 24-hour check-in and can be purchased as part of the original flight purchase or added to a flight after purchase. Price of EarlyBird Check-In may vary. Statement credit(s) will post to your account the same day your purchase posts to your account and will appear on your monthly credit card billing statement within 1-2 billing cycles. Account must be open and not in default at the time the statement credit is posted to your account. Statement credits will be issued for the anniversary year in which the transaction posts to your account. For example, if you purchase EarlyBird Check-In and Southwest does not post the transaction until after your current anniversary year ends, the cost of the EarlyBird Check-In services will be allocated towards the following year’s maximum of 2 services. More information can be found at Southwest.com/early-bird. Companion Pass Qualifying Points: Companion Pass® qualifying points are earned from revenue flights booked through Southwest®, points earned on Rapid Rewards® Credit Cards, and base points earned from Rapid Rewards partners. The following do not count as Companion Pass qualifying points: purchased points; points transferred between Members; points converted from hotel and car loyalty programs, e-Rewards®, Valued Opinions, and Diners Club®; points earned from Rapid Rewards program enrollment, tier bonus points; flight bonus points; and partner bonus points (with the exception of the Rapid Rewards Credit Cards from Chase). No points nor tier or Companion Pass qualifying points will be awarded for flights taken by the Companion when flying on a Companion Pass reservation. Points earned during a billing cycle on a Southwest Airlines Rapid Rewards Credit Card from Chase are not available for redemption or qualification for Companion Pass status until they are posted on your billing statement and posted to your Rapid Rewards account. Only points posted on your billing statements and posted to your Rapid Rewards account during the same calendar year are available for qualification for Companion Pass status. For example, if you make a purchase after your December billing statement cycle date, the points on those purchases will not count toward Companion Pass status in the year the purchase was made; they will appear on your January billing statement and post to your Rapid Rewards account in January. Companion Pass Qualifying Points Boost: As a Southwest Rapid Rewards Cardmember, you will earn one boost of 10,000 Companion Pass qualifying points each calendar year. The boost will be deposited into your eligible Rapid Rewards account by January 31st each calendar year or up to 30 days after account opening. To receive Companion Pass qualifying points boost your credit card account must be open and not in default at the time of fulfillment. Only one credit card account per Southwest Rapid Rewards Member (Rapid Rewards Member must be the primary Cardmember on that account), is eligible for one boost of 10,000 Companion Pass qualifying points per calendar year. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is not responsible for the provision of, or failure to provide, the stated benefits and services. No Blackout Dates and Unlimited Reward Seats: No blackout dates and unlimited reward seats apply to flights booked with points. No Change Fee: Fare difference may apply.

As survivors of that tragedy solemnly observed the anniversary in events in Oakland and San Francisco, they also spoke about sudden raids on their homes and the separation of families. About agriculture workers losing their only way to make a living. They all made the connection to what was happening in low-income and immigrant communities today — and sought to fight against injustice happening again.Their stories were a warning, a call for action, and a way to build further community in an age of distrust of “the other” through factual information.I hope you read the article and that you find the stories I learned about as thoughtful and moving as I did.

       "  'body': 'View this post on the web at week, we’re aging out of the wunderkind bracket, resisting a new theme song, grappling with dog ownership, and appreciating “Barry Lyndon.”AGEA portrait of the artist as a middle-aged manJared Young—an apt name, though perhaps a little cruel in this context—writes about aging past your idols, fighting the passage of time, and continuing to write regardless.Youth [ ]—Jared Young in Tolstoyan When he was in his early 20s, he hung a timeline above his desk. He had drawn it himself, meticulously, with a ruler and professional illustration pen. It spanned from 18 to 30, and he glue-sticked little pictures of his favorite authors next to the age at which they’d published their first novels. At 21, Bret Easton Ellis. At 24, Martin Amis. At 25, Michael Chabon and Zadie Smith. At 26, Philip Roth. At 27, John Updike. He cut out a picture of his own face and stuck it to the timeline among them. Every year, on his birthday, he moved his face one spot forward. Every year, he passed another one of his idols.All of the writers he admired were considered (at one time, at least) exceptional young writers, and he wanted nothing more than to be like them: an exceptional young writer. Writing a book, in and of itself, mattered less to him than doing it at a supernaturally young age. To be a prodigy, a wunderkind—that’s what aroused his ambitions. From the blurry vantage of Youth, failing to publish a novel before his 30th birthday would be his life’s ultimate failure.And, ultimately, he failed. He turned 30, then 31, and had nowhere to stick his cut-out face.To do a thing young is a shortcut to greatness. Everything you do right is evidence of your great potential, and all your mistakes are the mistakes of inexperience, which will be corrected, surely, by the passing of time. To write a poor sentence at the age of nineteen is expected (and quickly forgiven). To write a poor sentence at the age of forty-five—shouldn’t you know better by now? In this manner, being a not-young writer is a lose-lose proposition, because this principle applies to brilliant sentences, too. In youth, they are a marvel; later, they’re table stakes. Couples, which John Updike wrote when he was thirty-six, is considered one of his great accomplishments. But Villages, which he wrote at the age of seventy-two, is just as good. But of course it’s good—it was written by the guy who wrote Couples!The years that pass eat up your margin for error until there is no margin left. The mistakes you make are no longer flaws of inexperience, they are flaws of character. To be young is to be constantly on the precipice of perfection—just a little further and you’ll get there—but you never get there, and suddenly you’re old, and find yourself in a permanent state of imperfection, which you must reckon with.Keep reading [ ]PORTRAITTELEVISIONTV dramaSean Ross and Evan Ross Katz review the first episode of season 3 of The White Lotus, starting with the most shocking twist yet: a new theme song.The White Lotus, Season 3 Episode 1 “Same Spirits, New Forms” Recap [ ]—Sean Ross and Evan Ross Katz in Drop Your Buffs Keep listening [ ]And for good measure, here’s the new theme song:PHOTOGRAPHYPETSBad dogFather Karine on the trials and tribulations of coexisting with man’s best friend.An open letter to my dog who, if I’m being completely honest, lowkey kinda sucks [ ]—father_karine in father_karine Your name was Pablo or Toby. You were originally from Mexico, Brazil, or Florida. You were only 6 months or maybe 2 years old. You were found tied to a pole, trapped under burning rubble, or floating alone on a solitary iceberg off the east coast of Greenland. You were a husky mix, a pure-bred Labrador, or some made-up breed called a “black mouth cur.” You were a big loverboy, a snugglepuss, good in small apartments with even smaller children. Also good with: other dogs, cats, sassy parrots, loud noises, thin walls, and low-hanging chandeliers. “The only thing this big guy doesn’t do is stairs,” said the weird dog rescue guy. “I’m sure he has his reasons,” I replied. It wasn’t a problem for me. I lived on the ground floor. It was kismet.The dog rescue had curiously reduced your adoption fee from the standard $300 to $100, which was good because I love a sale. When I asked whether a home visit was necessary to make sure I was a suitable candidate to adopt you, the guy said, “Nah, we good.” As soon as I completed the adoption forms, a foghorn played over the loudspeakers and everyone at the expo center cheered for us, which is what happened each time one of these pitiable orphans found “their forever home.” Your adoption took less time than an episode of “Everybody Loves Raymond.” I’ve taken shits longer than the time I spent acquiring you. Within minutes, I became your legal owner and our lives would be connected until the end of time.[...]Once comfortable in your new home, you immediately destroyed all my things. You had a vendetta against electronics of any sort, so much so that I wondered if you might be an Amish dog that found your way here on Rumspringa. You chewed my laptop, TV wires, remote controls with the batteries inside them. The first time you ate some triple A batteries, I immediately rushed you to the vet and asked if we needed to pump your stomach. The vet said, “Nah, he good,” handed me a $300 bill, and sent us home.I bought a very large cage to “crate train” you because the internet said I had to do that. I watched a ton of videos on how to do it right. I placed the crate in the room I had been using as an office so you could have some peace and quiet. The internet—that lying, manipulative bitch—led me to believe that most dogs enjoy being crated. “Aw my dog loves hanging out in his crate, it gives him a sense of security :)” typed bigpawmama69. But you hated the crate more than any living thing has hated anything ever. As you violently scratched at the latch, the static energy from your polyester dog bed against the metal shot huge, demonic sparks into the air. You yelped and howled like your very soul was in pain every moment you were confined to the crate. It was just a prison to you.I crated you for a full month with little improvement. One time I left you crated while I ran errands, I came home to find you lying calmly on the living room sofa. The floor was covered in wood chips. You had somehow escaped and shawshank’d right through the wooden office door completely. That was the end of the crate and also the end of my security deposit. You won this round.Keep reading [ ]ARTPOETRYAlmonds [ ]—Joy Sullivan FILMAhead of its timeJC considers one of Stanley Kubrick’s most stunning—and entertaining! really!—films.Barry Lyndon [ ]—JC in CLAFOUTIS I’m used to thinking of Barry Lyndon as both my favorite film and the Kubrick movie nobody else was willing to sit through, but by now, 50 years after its release, only one of these things is true. Kubrick’s historical masterpiece is no longer neglected. It’s all over Twitter, it’s shown every year at art theaters here in New York, and it ranks high in directors’ and critics’ polls of greatest movies ever made. This took a while. When it came out, the movie was, by Kubrick’s standards, a flop. The director promised the producers that it would make nine figures. It barely made eight. It won a few Oscars but not the big ones, and the ones it did win—for art direction, cinematography, costume design, and music—seemed to underscore critics’ appraisal of the movie as a set piece, well-made but basically unengaging.What happened over the years to cause the critics to change their minds? I don’t really know, but my guess is: nothing, actually. In 1975, criticizing the film, Pauline Kael called it “a coffee-table movie.” In 2022, praising it, Jerry Saltz said, “Nothing happens.” Back then, critics found the movie beautiful but cold. Now they’re so grateful for the beauty that they don’t mind the cold. Meanwhile the public hasn’t changed its verdict at all: the vast majority of people didn’t see it then and still haven’t. But movie lovers see it, and for them the film’s obscurity has been a gift. They get to see it fresh, without the baggage of famous quotations and iconic images. Unlike Kubrick’s other movies, it isn’t required viewing—it’s a treat.The treat, contrary to the movie’s reputation, is not just the gorgeous photography and sets. The film is ridiculously entertaining. When it begins, Barry, a very silly young country would-be gentleman, is in love with his cousin. She rejects him for a British officer, Quinn, and Barry throws a fit and challenges the older man to a duel. When he shows up to fight, the grown-ups try patronizingly to dissuade him.QUINN: If Mr. Barry will apologize and go to Dublin, I will consider the whole affair honorably settled.BARRY’S FRIEND GROGAN: Say you’re sorry, Redmond.QUINN’S SECOND: Go on. You can easily say that.BARRY: I’m not sorry, and I’ll not apologize, and I’d as soon go to Dublin as to hell.It’s really no different from the part in Scarface when the penniless Tony Montana, after a coke dealer offers him $500 to do a pickup, shoots back, “500? Who do you think we are, baggage handlers?” It’s where the hero shows he’s made of different stuff than you expect. The plot of Barry Lyndon is basically the same as a mob movie: a ruthless young man rises from obscurity to the heights of success before losing it all and going to his ruin.Keep reading [ ]PAINTINGCOCKTAIL HOURSubstackers featured in this editionArt & Photography: Kristy Kensinger , Tokeya C.

The AI CUDA Engineer: Agentic CUDA Kernel Discovery, Optimization and Composition Watching: AI CUDA Engineer (paper/dataset) What problem does it solve? Modern AI systems, particularly foundation models like LLMs, face exponentially growing computational and energy demands during training and inference. While GPUs enable parallel processing, optimizing performance requires low-level expertise in CUDA kernel programming—a complex, hardware-specific skill. Most developers rely on high-level frameworks (e.g., PyTorch) that abstract away CUDA, sacrificing potential speed gains. This creates inefficiency, especially as AI scales, and limits accessibility to hardware-level optimizations. How does it solve the problem? Sakana AI developed The AI CUDA Engineer, an agentic framework combining frontier LLMs and evolutionary optimization. Instead of manual coding, the framework automates converting PyTorch operations into optimized CUDA kernels. It uses evolutionary strategies like “crossover” (mixing code snippets) and an “innovation archive” to iteratively discover highly efficient kernels. By leveraging LLMs to generate and refine CUDA code, the system bypasses human expertise barriers while exploring novel, hardware-aware optimizations. What are the key findings? The AI CUDA Engineer achieved 10–100x speedups over standard PyTorch operations and up to 5x faster performance than existing production-grade CUDA kernels. Crucially, the framework uncovered optimizations that even expert engineers might miss, demonstrating AI’s ability to “invent” better hardware-level solutions. Released with the work are 17,000 verified CUDA kernels and benchmark results showing 50x gains over unoptimized code. Why does it matter? Automated CUDA optimization democratizes high-performance computing, letting ML engineers focus on model design rather than hardware-specific tuning. It directly reduces inference costs for models like LLMs (critical for climate impact) and enables new applications needing real-time processing (e.g., robotics). By open-sourcing kernels, the work provides a foundation for future research in AI-driven code optimization. 2. Inner Thinking Transformer: Leveraging Dynamic Depth Scaling to Foster Adaptive Internal Thinking Watching: Inner Thinking Transformer (paper) What problem does it solve? LLMs often waste computational resources by treating all tokens (words or subwords) equally, even though some require far more complex reasoning. For example, solving a math problem or interpreting a metaphor involves a few critical tokens that demand deeper processing. Current Transformer architectures struggle here—they process every token with the same fixed number of layers, causing inefficient resource use and abrupt \"gradient spikes\" (mathematical signals indicating learning challenges) when handling hard tokens. How does it solve the problem? The authors reimagined the Transformer architecture by designing the Inner Thinking Transformer (ITT), which treats each layer as a dynamic \"thinking step.\" ITT adaptively routes critical tokens through more computational layers via Adaptive Token Routing, like giving a tricky math problem extra time to solve. It refines these tokens iteratively using Residual Thinking Connections, allowing the model to update its understanding gradually, similar to revising a rough draft. Additionally, Thinking Step Encoding tracks whether the model is in an early brainstorming phase or finalizing an answer, ensuring contextually aligned reasoning. What are the key findings? ITT achieves 96.5% of the performance of a 466M-parameter standard Transformer using just 162M parameters, demonstrating near-parity with a model nearly three times its size. It reduces training data requirements by 43.2% and outperforms traditional Transformers and recurrent variants in 11 benchmarks covering math, coding, and reasoning. Crucially, ITT eliminates gradient spikes caused by critical tokens, proving architectural strain can be mitigated without adding parameters. Why does it matter? ITT enables \"elastic\" efficiency: models that dynamically focus computational power where it matters most. This balance is vital for real-world applications, such as chatbots needing quick answers for simple queries and deeper reasoning for complex ones. The 43% reduction in training data lowers costs amid rising dataset expenses, while the architecture’s adaptability paves the way for smaller, smarter models—moving beyond the \"bigger is better\" paradigm in LLM development. 3. S*: Test Time Scaling for Code Generation Watching: S* (paper/code) What problem does it solve? While increasing computational effort during testing (\"test-time scaling\") has boosted LLM performance in domains like math, this approach hasn’t been deeply explored in code generation—a task where precision is critical. Code generation requires handling ambiguous instructions, edge cases, and syntactic correctness, but existing methods often struggle to reliably uncover the best solution among many potential outputs. This creates a gap in leveraging computational scaling to improve code quality, especially compared to well-studied areas like mathematical reasoning. How does it solve the problem? The authors designed S*, a hybrid framework blending two strategies: parallel scaling (generating many code candidates at once) and sequential scaling (iteratively refining outputs). To pick the best candidate, S* introduces an adaptive \"distinguishing input\" mechanism that crafts test cases to compare pairs of solutions and uses execution-grounded feedback (i.e., actually running the code) to validate correctness. This tackles both coverage (exploring diverse solutions) and selection (picking accurate ones) challenges in one system. What are the key findings? S* dramatically improved performance across 12 models: (1) A smaller 3B model using S* outperformed GPT-4o-mini; (2) Non-reasoning-focused models surpassed specialized reasoning models (e.g., GPT-4o-mini + S* beat o1-preview by 3.7%); (3) State-of-the-art reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B hit 85.7% accuracy on LiveCodeBench with S*, nearing the 88.5% benchmark of top proprietary models. These gains were consistent across model sizes and architectures. Why does it matter? Code generation tools must balance accuracy with computational cost. S* demonstrates that smarter test-time strategies—not just bigger models—can unlock high performance, democratizing access to quality code generation for smaller models or organizations. By combining execution-based validation with flexible scaling, the approach bridges the gap between exploratory output generation and reliable selection, a key hurdle for real-world deployment. This could reduce reliance on massive-scale models while improving robustness in critical scenarios. Papers of the Week: Do Large Language Models Reason Causally Like Us? Even Better?

       "  'body': \" FRIDAYFebruary 21, 2025 following is a sample of the Munk Debates’ Friday Focus podcast.On this week's Friday Focus, Rudyard and Janice start the show by talking about Donald Trump's personal attack on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Are business opportunities in Russia causing the US to abandon its allies and European partners? The long-term consequence of this - depriving the US of any legitimacy among Democratic states - is catastrophic. Rudyard and Janice then turn to Taiwan and the South China Sea where Xi Jinping is taking advantage of USAID's closure to leverage Chinese money and gain influence abroad. In the absence of American power and pressure, can the Chinese leader get the territory he has long sought without military force?To access the full-length editions of the Friday Focus podcast consider becoming a donor ( to the Munk Debates for as little as $25 annually, or $.50 per episode.

       "  'body': 'View this post on the web at Quant Firm’s Unconventional Bet on AGIIn the high-stakes race for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), the usual suspects dominate the battlefield—Silicon Valley behemoths, trillion-dollar cloud providers, and well-funded AI startups backed by the world’s leading venture capital firms. But nestled within this storm is a player that few saw coming: a Chinese quantitative hedge fund.DeepSeek [ ], a newly formed AI research lab, isn’t just another startup chasing the AI gold rush. It’s an audacious moonshot launched by High-Flyer Quant [ ], one of China’s most powerful quant trading firms, managing over 100 billion RMB ($14 billion) in assets. While many AI companies pivot toward commercial applications, DeepSeek [ ] has set its sights on something far more ambitious—to uncover the mysteries of intelligence itself.“Why do this?” asks Liang Wenfeng, the enigmatic founder of High-Flyer [ ]. “The real question is: why not? If we want to do it, and we have the means to do it, then we are one of the most qualified to take on this challenge.”It’s the kind of conviction that borders on madness—yet it’s exactly this brand of audacity that has defined High-Flyer [ ]’s journey from the beginning.The Making of a Maverick: High-Flyer’s Rise from Outsider to PowerhouseTo understand DeepSeek [ ]’s origins, one must first understand High-Flyer [ ]’s improbable ascent.Unlike China’s other top quant funds—many of which were founded by Wall Street veterans—High-Flyer had no roots in global finance. Liang Wenfeng, a self-taught AI researcher, never worked for a hedge fund, never studied in the U.S., and never followed the industry’s conventional wisdom.Instead, his story begins in a cheap apartment in Chengdu, where he spent his early years obsessively coding and testing AI models, convinced that artificial intelligence would change the world. It was 2008—long before AI became fashionable—and his vision was seen as nothing short of delusional.Around that time, a friend invited him to join an equally ambitious but seemingly impractical project: a drone startup operating out of a cramped rental in Shenzhen’s urban villages. Liang declined, preferring to focus on his own research.That friend? He went on to build DJI [ ], now a multi-billion-dollar global drone empire.Liang, however, remained in the shadows, quietly applying his AI expertise to one of the most complex and high-stakes industries in existence: finance. By 2015, he had launched High-Flyer [ ], using AI-driven models to execute thousands of trades per second. By 2021, the fund had grown into a quant giant, reaching a staggering 100 billion RMB AUM in just six years.But Liang was never just a finance guy. He was always an AI researcher at heart.A Quiet AI Superpower: The GPU Reserves No One Saw ComingWhile the world fixated on ChatGPT [ ]’s rise, High-Flyer [ ] had already been building its AI arsenal for years, in near-total secrecy.In 2019, the firm launched Firefly One [ ], a deep-learning training platform built with 1,100 GPUs, at an initial investment of 200 million RMB ($28 million).By 2021, they had unveiled Firefly Two [ ], upgrading their infrastructure to 10,000 NVIDIA A100 GPUs, with a total investment exceeding 1 billion RMB ($140 million).To put this into perspective: according to Caijing Eleven, only five companies in China possessed more than 10,000 GPUs at the time—Alibaba [ ], Tencent [ ], Baidu [ ], ByteDance [ ]… and High-Flyer Quant [ ].In a country where AI startups struggled with severe GPU shortages, High-Flyer had quietly secured enough compute power to train its own large-scale AI models—long before many realized the stakes.This was no accident.“For years, we’ve been obsessed with understanding the limits of AI’s computational power,” Liang explains. “We didn’t buy GPUs because we knew we’d do AGI one day. We bought them because we were curious.”That curiosity has now led to DeepSeek [ ], a research lab dedicated to building foundational AI models—not finance-specific tools, not chatbots, but true AGI.“We Are Not Here to Monetize—We Are Here to Explore”Unlike OpenAI [ ], which started as a nonprofit but later pivoted to commercialization, DeepSeek [ ] is taking an entirely different approach:No immediate commercial applications.No quick monetization strategy.No interest in building AI tools for financial markets.“We are not a fintech AI lab,” Liang clarifies. “We are here to explore the fundamental nature of intelligence.”This makes DeepSeek [ ] an anomaly. In a world where most AI startups race toward enterprise clients or SaaS models, DeepSeek [ ] has no products, no business plan, and no interest in short-term ROI.That has made it difficult to attract traditional VC funding.“Most investors want quick returns,” Liang says. “We don’t fit that model. But we don’t need to. We have our own capital. And for now, that is enough.”With billions in quant trading profits, High-Flyer [ ] has the luxury of funding DeepSeek’s research indefinitely.But this doesn’t mean DeepSeek [ ] is operating in isolation. Liang envisions a future where AI research remains open and accessible, ensuring that even small developers can build on top of their work.“The power of AI should not be monopolized by a handful of companies,” he says. “That’s why, when the time comes, we plan to open-source much of our research.”The Final Frontier: Can Curiosity Outlast Competition?If history has shown anything, it’s that the AI race is not just about technology—it’s about endurance.OpenAI [ ], DeepMind [ ], and Anthropic [ ] have collectively burned through billions of dollars in funding, with AGI still a distant dream. Even with its deep pockets and GPU empire, DeepSeek [ ] faces a formidable challenge: can it sustain its curiosity-driven research for the long haul?When asked how long they’re willing to keep going, Liang doesn’t hesitate.“For as long as it takes,” he says. “Because at the end of the day, this isn’t about money. It’s about answering the questions that keep us awake at night.”That, perhaps, is DeepSeek [ ]’s greatest advantage. Not compute power. Not funding. But the sheer obsession of a team that refuses to stop asking:What if?Final Thoughts: Is DeepSeek the Next OpenAI… or Something Else Entirely?DeepSeek [ ] may never be a household name. It may never launch a consumer AI product. It may never make billions from licensing its models.But that’s not why it exists.It exists because a group of people refuse to accept the limits of current AI. Because a quant fund with no reason to chase AGI decided to chase it anyway. Because, as François Truffaut [ ] once said:“You must be madly ambitious. And you must be madly sincere.”DeepSeek [ ] is both.And in the end, that might just be enough.About The AuthorConnect with Sophie REN [ ] on LinkedIn.About The Bay Area Founders ClubThe Bay Area Founders Club (BFC), founded by Dr. Paul Fang [ ] in Silicon Valley in 2022 and managed by a dedicated group of Stanford alumni and students, is a thriving community of over 30,000 members, including more than 1000 startups and over 350 venture capital firms.

       "  'body': 'View this post on the web at are a ravenous bunch, hungry for food 24-7. We snack on food-creator videos like they’re fancy hors d’oeuvres, gorge ourselves on cooking shows, and can spend hours savoring long-form essays on Malaysian cuisine like they’re fine old wines.It didn’t used to be this way.Once upon another time, food was little more than sustenance. There was no conversation about the provenance of the fish on your plate. No one wanted to know the name of the chef at the restaurant round the corner (or to spend half an hour watching their knife skills on your phone). You ate the food in front of you, preferably with good people around. That was how it was.The world of food was smaller back then; certainly less entertaining and intellectually bountiful, tied up at both ends by the few who felt entitled to talk about it. It was the land of the great and the godly—the eminent food writers at one end, the celebrity TV chefs at the other.But not anymore. We are 30 years into a food revolution that has seen cookbooks become as pacy as pulp fiction. Social media stars being made out of teens experimenting in their mum and dad’s kitchen. The world of food writing and restaurant reviews has been handed over to anyone who has an interesting point of view about food, while videos about food—gonzo tasting trips, cook-alongs, documentaries—are now as entertaining as a Hollywood film.Nowhere is this shift more evident than on Substack, where the world of food and the new power players within it are pushing boundaries, galvanizing communities, and revolutionizing the food industry.Here, you’ll find both established names exploring new ideas and fresh new voices tearing away at the established ways of doing things. Here is a place where food people can express themselves and their ideas about food exactly as they want—through writing, of course, and in podcasts, videos, live videos, and community chats.You can step inside the mind of Yotam Ottolenghi as he shares his thoughts on AI and the future of restaurants [ ] (as well as his secret cauliflower recipes [ ]). You can join Notorious Foodie on his search for the perfect tavern burger [ ]. Or watch social media cooking sensation Tini Younger as she whips up her famous “cheese with noods [ ]” from the comfort of her own home. And subscribers can connect directly with these creators in comments and chats, asking questions and sharing feedback as they go. In this way, Substack not only brings you, the audience, closer to your food heroes than ever before—it also brings your food heroes closer to you.Whether they’re Michelin-starred chefs or budding food vloggers, creators are reimagining what the future of food media looks like. Take Jonathan Nunn’s Vittles , which started life as a food newsletter but has gone on to become one of the most culturally en pointe magazines in the world. Or Caroline Chambers ’s community chat channel, which has become the hottest place in town to discuss everything from what cookware to buy to how to pick the best winter veggies. Some of the world’s most celebrated food writers, like Edd Kimber , Ruth Reichl , and Anna Jones , share the actual places they pay to eat at, while Meg Zimbeck ’s PARIS BY MOUTH has become as vital as the Michelin Guide for figuring out exactly where to get a table in Paris.My point is this: food, and the conversations and content being created around it, has never been more exciting. And we want everyone to be part of it.To that end, next month we’re hosting an event we’re calling Grubstack: a live video food festival taking place from March 13 to 15 showcasing the new frontier of food media.Listen in as New York super-chef Clare de Boer chews the fat with culinary guru Dorie Greenspan . Join David Lebovitz and Yotam Ottolenghi as they discuss their lives and careers in food. Explore the Spanish food markets of San Sebastián with Nicola Lamb , and listen in as Ben Lippett tells the tale of how he left the world of cheffing to become a Substack sensation. This is just a taste; stay tuned for the full lineup and schedule. Every session will stream live in the Substack app, bringing a food festival to the palm of your hand.This is a golden age of food media—one that feels warmer, more intimate, more ambitious, more inclusive, and, most of all, more democratic than ever before. Come and take your seat at the table, starting on March 13.Host your own Grubstack eventIf you’d like to participate in the food festival by hosting your own live video, send us an email at grubstack@substackinc.com.

       "  'timestamp': '2025-02-21 08:50:29-08',\n",
       "  'body': ' [ ]Sign the petition and send a clear message to President Trump and Elon Musk: Hands off our Social Security! Once we reach at least 75,000 signatures, we\\'ll deliver the petition! Dear MoveOn member, Elon Musk\\'s DOGE (the so-called \"Department of Government Efficiency\"), only cares about taking money from everyday people to line Musk\\'s own pockets. Despite President Trump\\'s many campaign promises to protect Social Security, he is not only allowing but endorsing Musk\\'s attempts to steal your hard-earned Social Security benefits.^1 In case you missed it: Since Trump\\'s Inauguration Day, Elon Musk has been running around slashingfunds allocated by Congress to essential services—like cancer and health care research, SNAP, Medicaid and Medicare, and more. And in a not so shocking reveal, these cuts are not saving ANY working person money.^2 [ ]And earlier today, senate Republicans passed a budget resolution that could put essential programs like Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare at risk of major cuts.^3 So why is this happening? By raiding our Social Security and gutting essential services, Musk, Trump, and their billionaire friends will benefit from massive tax cuts and profit from the everyday person\\'s struggle. And both Trump and Musk are going to continue to take money away from people who need it to survive, just to give tax giveaways to the 1%.^4 And in just the last few weeks, Musk has used his platform on X to spread outrageous lies about Social Security to frame his pro-billionaire agenda as a righteous attack.^5Just last week, Musk talked to reporters in the Oval Office to try to convince the public that the Social Security system is full of fraud, saying, \"we\\'ve got people in there that are 150 years old.”^6 [ ]Now he\\'s just making things up to justify a long-held Republican dream of cutting and privatizing Social Security and other essential, lifesaving programs. Sign the petition to fight back against this affront to Social Security and the outright theft of benefits from tens of millions of retired Americans. We\\'ve had enough of these CUTS. Sign the petition and tell Donald Trump and Elon Musk: HANDS OFF OUR SOCIAL SECURITY! [4]Sign the petition Trump is giving Elon Musk the power to steal benefits that people have earned. And Musk is using the standard MAGA Republican playbook to do it: Make an issue out of a non-issue, cause chaos, and then get rid of it and claim the win—and this time it\\'s at the expense of nearly every American. Social Security benefits are given to workers who have put decades of their lives into their work, and each of those people have earned the right to access the promise of Social Security afforded to all citizens during their elder years. [ ]We all deserve to retire with dignity. Musk is lying about Social Security while he and his own team are getting their hands into the U.S. Treasury\\'s payments system. Thus, Musk had access to the Social Security numbers of every federal worker and Social Security beneficiary.^7He also had access to our bank account numbers, and other sensitive, private information.^8Enough is enough. Social Security benefits cannot and should not be cut, and any member of Congress who supports these cuts is doing a disservice to every constituent they have.Social Security is meant to allow people to retire with dignity Congress must reassert its authority, Musk must go, and everyone must commit to protecting Social Security NOW. [ ]Sign the petition toadd your name to this petition, and then pass it along to your friends so we can reach our signature count goal. Together, we\\'ll show the folks in Washington that we will NOT just watch Social Security be taken away from us. Thanks for all you do. –Nakia, Emily, Amandah B., Mona, and the rest of the team [ ]P.S.Weneed every single member of Congress to fight back against these deadly cuts to our communities. After you sign the petition, take 2 minutes to send a letter to your representatives demanding they fight back against ANY cuts to Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare and the programs that impact millions.

Dear MoveOn member, The results of this election weren't what we were hoping for, and we know how you may be feeling.You're not alone. Trump’s win feels like a setback—a heavy blow to our fight for justice, equality, and the future we envisioned. We are here with you. It's OK to feel angry, upset, or even hopeless right now.Take your time to feel it all, but know the fight is not over. We know the hard work you poured into getting out the vote this year. From phone-banking and canvassing to speaking to friends and neighbors, your dedication has been awe-inspiring.As painful and concerning as it is, Trump is returning to the White House, so we must regroup, be clear about what's at stake, and plan our next steps together. [ ]This setback isn't the end—our fight for a country where everyone can thrive continues. Start your petition on an issue you care about—no matter how big or small—and use the power of your voice to make change in your community. The power of our voices, our shared determination, our unwavering dedication—it's all still here. Every door you knocked on, every call you made, every conversation you had was not in vain.We've planted seeds of change across the country, and those seeds are growing. Yes, Trump won this election, but he has not won our future. That future belongs to us.And now, more than ever, we need to rally together and keep pushing forward. The issues we care about—climate change, health care, reproductive rights, racial justice, and upholding democracy—are more urgent than ever.Trump's victory might encourage those who want to dismantle our rights, but it should also fuel our perseverance to protect and fight for them even harder.[ ]Will you start a petition about an issue you care about? [4]Start a petition There is no doubt that Trump and Republicans are going to do everything in their power to keep stripping us of our rights and freedoms at the federal, state, and local level. This is our moment to stand strong, to show that we are not going to back down just because the outcome wasn't what we were hoping for. The fight for our rights, our dignity, and our democracy continues, and it's up to us to lead it. [ ]We need you—all of us—to stay in this fight. Start a petition on the issue that matters most to you, and let's keep this momentum going. Starting your petition is just the beginning. With MoveOn's platform, you can share it with friends, family, and fellow MoveOn members and gain the support you need to make an impact. The process is straightforward, and our team is here to help you every step of the way. [ ]Don't wait—take action now by starting a petition and be the voice that drives the change we need. Many of us are still grieving, and that's OK. Feel the weight of this moment, let yourself process it, and when you're ready, remember: We cannot give up. We're worth fighting for. Our shared future is worth fighting for. And together, we will rise again and push for the better world we all deserve. Thank you for all you do. –Valeria, Aliya, Jensine, Isbah, and the rest of the team Want to support MoveOn's work?The MoveOn community will work every moment, day by day and year by year, to resist Trump's agenda, contain the damage, defeat hate with love, and begin the process of swinging the nation's pendulum back toward sanity, decency, and the kind of future that we must never give up on. And to do it MoveOn needs your ongoing support, now more than ever.Will you stand with MoveOn? [ ]Yes, I'll chip in $5 a month.

Chan and Dr. Hamlet Medina to discover the diverse applications of GenAI in finance. Understand the potential of GenAI and the role of LLMs in trading. Register Now Dr. Ernest P. Chan Founder and Chief Scientist, PredictNow.ai Dr. Hamlet Medina Chief Data Scientist at Criteo FAQs on Applications of LLMs for Trading What are the limitations of using general-purpose LLMs like ChatGPT for financial tasks? General-purpose LLMs like ChatGPT are trained on a wide range of data, which makes them versatile but not specialised. They may not have the financial expertise required for specific tasks, leading to less accurate or irrelevant outputs compared to specialised financial LLMs. How do Financial LLMs differ from general-purpose LLMs? Financial LLMs are trained on finance-specific datasets, such as market data, financial reports, and regulatory communications. This specialisation allows them to perform tasks like sentiment analysis, news classification, and predictive modelling more accurately than general-purpose LLMs. Is it possible to create a completely automated trading system using LLMs? While LLMs can automate parts of a trading system, a fully automated system would require integrating multiple components, including data feeds, execution algorithms, risk management, and continuous monitoring. Human oversight is still essential to ensure the system operates correctly.

       "  'body': 'Issue #273: Flooding in Kentucky, Socrates, and letting goThe Medium Newsletter ( newsletter byThe Medium Blog ( 21, 2025∙3 min read∙View on Medium ( tricks to memoir writing: tell the truth and curate your detailsIssue #273: Flooding in Kentucky, Socrates, and letting goMeghan Daum, author of My Misspent Youth (excerpted here ( by the New Yorker), said memoir is often described as \"navel-gazing,\" and \"indulgent\" ( because many writers \"treat it sloppily and without respect.\"While honesty is the key to good memoir writing, Daum warns this doesn\\'t mean you should \"include every detail, play out every emotional drama.\" A memoir writer should instead be wary of becoming too confessional, or \"blurting out a bunch of stuff and just leaving it there for shock value.\"The day I got a ketamine infusion while my house burned down ( by Kate Alexandria ( gets this balance right. Alexandria\\'s home did indeed burn down during January\\'s Altadena fire, while she was getting a ketamine infusion. She essentially slept through the destruction, and I found myself riveted to every word.Alexandria strikes the balance Daum recommends by simply writing honestly about what happened, fact by fact, detail by detail. Reflections are sprinkled throughout, but they aren\\'t overwrought or dramatic; she remains honest while not exploding all over the page. Two sentences that made me feel like I was there: \"The air was thick and acrid with angry, fresh smoke. As far as the eye could see, stretching up Lake Avenue until it disappeared in the haze and the orange brightness of flame, there were cars bumper-to-bumper.\" (Fortunately or unfortunately, she didn\\'t sleep through all of it.)I see this, too, in The Making of an Invisible Child ( by Milena Babic ( It bills itself as a piece about parenting advice, but that wildly undersells what it actually is: a brutally honest account of losing a parent\\'s love. One day Babic\\'s father adored her, the next he was undermining her at every turn, rendering Babic invisible. Babic writes about this in a dreamlike way, and unlike Alexandria\\'s piece, nothing feels concrete. And yet it also remains honest without tipping overboard. One of many favorite lines: \"Dad\\'s silent treatments smelled like newspapers.\"But I suspect the formula for a good memoir is even simpler. As Ta-Nehisi Coates reminds us ( \"Don\\'t fucking lie.\"- Adeline DimondWhat else we\\'re readingKentucky is underwater again, and the devastation ( is hard to process. Kentucky is also, as Coyote Wallace ( writes, deeply misunderstood. In Hungry Like Me: The False Prophets of Poverty, ( Wallace explains why Kentuckians who live below the poverty line often support Trump. (Wallace does not, for the record.) It boils down to a question of trust. \"If how we Appalachians are presented in the eyes of the media is incorrect,\" Wallace writes, \"then it follows that the people who have long mocked us and refused our cries for representation would also lie about Trump.\"If you\\'ve been looking for an accessible primer on Socrates, you\\'re in luck. Massimo Pigliucci ( a professor of philosophy at the City College of New York, provides one here ( One moment that stuck out to me: Socrates wandered around Athens interviewing politicians, poets, craftsmen\\u200a-\\u200aall so-called \"experts\" who ultimately couldn\\'t explain their expertise. His conclusion? The wisest people readily admit their lack of wisdom.💡 Your daily dose of practical wisdomThe next time someone hurts or disappoints you, let them ( You\\'ll stop wasting energy on things you could have never controlled in the first place.···Deepen your understanding every day with the Medium Newsletter.

       "  'body': \"View image: ( View image: ( image link: ( Welcome, humans. Y’all remember when Snapchat filters hit the scene, and fundamentally changed the selfie? Well, we’re seeing some early signs that “AI filters” could soon do the same.Yesterday, we briefly mentioned[ Pika]( one of the top AI video generators, then lo and behold, they just launched something new: It’s called [Pikaswaps]( and it’s basically the genAI equivalent of the Snapchat filter. Check it out:Youtube: Introducing Pikaswaps! ( Pika already has 12M+ users (_WILD!), _and just dropped its first[ iOS app]( to create mind-bending videos on the go. Think turning selfies into memes, adding fantastical elements ([like Yoda]( to real footage, or transforming photos into dynamic videos with just a text prompt.Oh, and btw, don’t forget that Google also just made it so[ creators can use its Veo 2 video generator]( to create background filters for videos. _Friendly reminder to no longer trust anything you see!_**Here’s what you need to know about AI today:*** GPT-4.5 is imminent and ChatGPT now has 400M monthly active users.* Figure demo’d robots working together using a single AI system.* Spotify added ElevenLabs AI voices for audiobooks.* Sakana AI made GPU code run up to 100x faster.Advertise in The Neuron here. ( image: ( # GPT-4o is… _different_, but at least GPT-4.5 is coming any day now…Only looking at the headlines, you could argue OpenAI hasn’t had the best two weeks; first, Elon [tried to disrupt]( its non-profit to for-profit transition by [offering to purchase]( the non-profit. Then, Elon [released Grok 3]( and claimed it achieved early benchmarks outperforming OpenAI’s models.Even OpenAI’s [new benchmark]( for freelance software engineers was [one-upped by Claude]( Sonnet.While all this _might*_ have caused some scrambling behind the scenes, it doesn’t seem to have impacted the core business of selling AI.**Because by all accounts, OpenAI is crushing it: **As OpenAI’s COO Brad Lightcap says, ChatGPT is now up to [400M weekly active users]( And that’s [not all]( 2M+ business users now wield ChatGPT for work.2. Reasoning Model API usage increased 5x since o3-mini went live.3. GPT-5, when it goes live “soon,” will be totally free with no usage caps.Confused about why OpenAI would give away GPT-5 for free? Turns out Pro and Plus users will get more inference (the time ChatGPT takes to generate its answers) for more complicated tasks. Right now, OpenAI does this via “low,” “medium,” and “high” settings, but a slider scale like [Anthropic plans to release]( with its new Claude model is a lot more user-friendly.**Speaking of GPT-5**—According to a [report by The Verge]( it looks like Microsoft is prepping OpenAI’s GPT-4.5 and GPT-5 models to go live on its Azure servers as you read this.GPT-4.5 may be on its way, but a new GPT-4o is already here.** **As Ethan Mollick shared, [something's different about GPT-4o]( but OpenAI isn't saying what. Sam hinted at this [with a cryptic tweet]( but there’s no real evidence in the usual places ([LM Leaderboard]( [OpenAI’s own records]( image: ( image link: ( **Here’s what we know about the update:*** GPT-4o seems generally “smarter” and less likely to refuse requests.* Many specialized custom GPTs (like AI illustrators) are completely broken.* Ethan’s [Innovation GPT]( w/ 10K+ users stopped working entirely).* Text-based GPTs appear mostly unaffected.* No official documentation or warning was provided about the changes.This creates a thorny problem for businesses building on OpenAI's tech. Some devs are already jumping ship to open-source alternatives like [DeepSeek]( or [Llama]( where they can host their own models and avoid surprise updates breaking their products.**Our take:** This is the double-edged sword of working with OpenAI. We want better models, but those ~2M business users need stability. With GPT-4.5 and GPT-5 on the horizon, OpenAI will need to figure out how to roll out some [pretty big changes]( without disrupting the ecosystem they've built._Worth noting: OpenAI released a _[_major update_]( to the _[_Model Spec_]( on February 12th that could have something to do with this…_View image: ( ###### **FROM OUR PARTNERS**# 💼 Want to become an AI Consultant?View image: ( image link: ( **This stat is WILD:** The AI consulting market is projected to explode from $6.9 billion to $54.7 billion by 2032.
