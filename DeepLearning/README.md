Based on the research of the authors of this [whitepaper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.07031.pdf), I trained a Convolutional Neural Network to classify the physical activities of users wearing wrist devices that contain sensors like an accelerometer and gyroscope. In order words, the CNN was trained on time-series data and not images and performed quite well.
