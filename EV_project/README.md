#### TL;DR
- Understand the distributions of EV performance metrics and driver behavior at EV charging stations
- Run statistical hypothesis testing on EV driver charging behavior
- Create correlation model between EV performance metrics and price
- Cluster EVs based on performance metrics and create two tiers
- Create EV energy price model and compare results between EV tiers and brands
